                        <h1 id="about-this-book">About This Book</h1>
<p>The web is hard. For some of us it seems completely alien and impenetrable. Others have perhaps grown up with it and witnessed how it&#39;s changed the world, while others still have fully embraced it and incorporated it into their lives. The internet revolution, and surely it is a revolution, has brought about such rapid change in society - business and commerce, politics and journalism, social attitudes, recreation, etc. - that people have a hard time keeping up. And that&#39;s what this book is about -
<strong>people</strong>.</p>
<p>People are constantly trying to explore new ways to exploit the web for their industry or sector of society, to make use of the available technology to do something that will have an impact. Building any website or web app involves a multitude of different expertise and processes and almost always involves people working together, whether it be a single entrepreneur making use of others&#39; open-source software or a large agency producing corporate platforms.</p>
<p>One of the great things about working on the web is that it&#39;s so open and friendly. There are countless tools, frameworks, templates, libraries we can use to get started, as well as forums and reference sites where we can ask for help when we get stuck. Help is offered freely and enthusiastically by complete strangers from all over the world.</p>
<p>And yet, producing a really outstanding website or app is <strong>hard</strong>. You&#39;ve got all those incredible resources online, you have a great idea, great designers, developers, project managers and any other people you might need but it can still go so terribly wrong. Why is that? Why do we still frequently struggle with such terrible online experiences when we&#39;ve seen other websites and web apps do the same thing so well?</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#39;s the same reason as building projects going wrong - remaining incomplete, going over-budget, or failing safety inspections. Or like companies collapsing under the competition - think Kodak or Nokia with their abundant cash and resources and yet seemingly blind to or defenseless against the looming tide of new technology. These buildings and companies fail due to individual decisions by individual people, or even the lack of decisions. A web project going wrong, or even not turning out the very best that it can, is less likely to be the result of sloppy design or poor implementation of the technology - those are easy to fix. It&#39;s likely to be an issue with the way people communicate, interact, and work together.</p>
<p>Maybe you&#39;ve heard of the stereotypical feud between designers and developers, both sides gleering at the other in mutual derision and distrust, even bouts of carpal-tunnel fueled fury? And are all clients feared and loathed in equal measure? Or maybe you&#39;ve purchased services from an agency to work on your product and have been disappointed time after time, only to go back for more?</p>
<p>Throughout this book we&#39;re going to look at all the roles involved in producing a web project and how they need to cooperate. You might not fit exactly into one of those roles, or maybe you&#39;re single-handedly covering several of them yourself (bravo!). Either way, it&#39;s important to understand what&#39;s involved and how you can work with or perform the other roles more successfully. The ultimate goal is to bring people together in a way that can optimise the success of every web project and thus make the web a better place for all.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-web-project-">What is a “Web Project”</h2>
<p>First let&#39;s define what kind of projects we&#39;re talking about. For the purposes of this book, a web project is anything involving the production or maintenance of a website or web app. This could be a standalone website or app, or it could be a single component or page. It could even be a “back-end” system for serving data to the user interface. To further narrow it down, production and maintenance may include planning, design, implementation, and testing. A website or web app is a web-connected interface that can be accessed via an internet-enabled device; it may be used from inside a web browser, or from within a native mobile or desktop app. It&#39;s essentially a way of serving content to end users.</p>
<p>So using these definitions, a web project might include the following examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>An e-commerce website</li>
<li>A dashboard interface</li>
<li>A web services API</li>
<li>A marketing minisite</li>
<li>A hybrid iOS or Android app</li>
<li>Content Management System (CMS) integration</li>
</ul>
<p>This book does not aim to cover such projects as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rebranding - logo design, stationary etc.</li>
<li>Social media management</li>
<li>Website analytics assessment</li>
<li>Database management systems</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="who-this-book-is-for">Who this Book is For</h2>
<p>This book is aimed at all stakeholders in any web project. If you&#39;re reading this, that probably means you!</p>
<p>We&#39;ll go through chapters which encompass a role or set of roles involved in a web project. You should obviously focus on roles that you may be involved in, although it&#39;s also important to understand the roles of others whom you may work with.</p>
<p>The roles are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Website Owners</strong></p>
<p>The primary stakeholder, the one who&#39;s idea or financing has brought about the creation of the web project, and who profits from the web project itself. This may be, for example, an entrepreneur or startup founder, or the marketing manager of a large company. Website owners know their business and their goals better than anyone and (hopefully) have a good idea of how exactly they want the web project to turn out in order to achieve those goals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Directors</strong></p>
<p>The secondary stakeholder, directors represent the production team, and are the ones who make ultimate production decisions, hire teams, and profit from the production of web projects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Account Managers</strong></p>
<p>The interface between the website owner and everyone else, channeling communication both ways. Startups and in-house teams may not necessarily have this role, but agencies and freelancers do.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Project Managers</strong></p>
<p>Like a foreman on a building site, the project manager coordinates decisions about workflow and tools, coordinates communication, and monitors and maintains project progress.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Content Managers</strong></p>
<p>All web projects have content. The very essense of any web project is its content. Content managers determine what that content should be and how it should be presented to the end users.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Designers</strong></p>
<p>People involved in determining how the web project should look, feel, and behave when presented to the end user.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Developers</strong></p>
<p>Code monkeys. Only kidding. The developers are the ones who build the structure of the web project and write the code that performs the main functionality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Testers</strong></p>
<p>People involved in ensuring the web project meets all stated goals, from design, performance, accessibility, device/browser compatibility, SEO etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-this-book-is">What this Book Is</h2>
<p>This book is simply a guide or overview. While it may be opinionated in parts, it describes a realistic and achievable ideal. It&#39;s about changing the way we work together and the decisions we make in order to improve the chances of success. By understanding fully the requirements for success and the work involved, chances of success increase. You may not agree with all the advice or maybe the goals may seem lofty and unachievable, but you may find small parts useful or be able to make small incremental changes to improve the way you work.</p>
<p>Of course, when talking about success you need to establish some goals to measure against. Those goals are up to you. The overall goal here is to make the web better for everyone and if something you do as a result of reading this book improves the quality of your work then the goal will have been achieved.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-book-isn-t">What this Book Isn&#39;t</h2>
<p>This book is not a technical manual, a bible, a source of reference, a set of explicit rules, a code resource, or a toolkit. It&#39;s just a collection of thoughts and ideas to hopefully inspire people.</p>
