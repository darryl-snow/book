# Website Owners

_Reading time ~ 35 minutes_

Your role is the most important. You may think that you're paying a production team to do all the hard work and take it out of your hands but unfortunately that simply isn't the case. If you were opening a shop you wouldn't expect the painters & decorators to establish your product display, prices, general business practices, hire staff etc. Before embarking on this project you need to have a detailed plan, not just about what kind of web project you want but how you plan to use it, how you plan to maintain and grow it, who will use it, and what they will use it for. There is an awful lot to think about and you need to accurately convey those thoughts to your production team.

The ultimate success of the web project starts and ends with you. How much you care about it, and how much resources you spend on it will be obvious to the end user. Even a brilliant production team using robust technology may produce a failed project if there are organisational issues at your end.

## What is a web project?

Wait... didn't we cover this in the first chapter? Yes, but that was more of a cold and impersonal definition. Here we're talking about what a web project could be in the context of your business or organisation. Websites were once seen as simply a marketing tool but are increasingly becoming more business-critical and central to many organisations.

Your web project is a long-term investment in your organisation. Indeed it's not a cheap investment and so does need to be vigilantly cared for and maintained in order to maximise the return on that investment.

Seth Godin came up with a brilliant analogy that a website is not like a building, with rigid timelines within which architects draw up plans and engineers build a fixed solid structure. A website, he says, is more like a garden. It develops over a long time, getting better with more time and care. They grow and have to be trimmed, pruned, and replanted. They change with the seasons, gain personality, and reflect their environment. They can never be perfect and may always have messy or dirty bits, but ultimately with a little light, good drainage, and a passionate gardener they can be a thing of beauty. It really is a great analogy - by all means build but never finish or walk away.

That means you should forget timelines completely - it's never going to be finished so your timeline will just be a path to infinity. By all means set (or rather, accept) deadlines for individual parts or features of the project; perhaps you have a product launch or a marketing activity around a particular festival or holiday, but that's only part of your project.

You should also forget trying to decide on a complete feature set and waiting to launch the project until those features are complete. This approach presents several problems:

* All features are unvalidated assumptions until tested on real users. The more you build before exposing to real users the more time and effort you are expending without full confidence that what you've produced is what your users need or want.


* It creates more work designing each feature without any data on which to base design decisions.


* Large outlay cost in terms of time and money. These resources may be better spent refining existing features than expanding on the current feature set.


* Lack of focus and prioritisation - the more features your project presents the more divided the users' attention may be and the more difficult it will be to identify user behaviour and draw decisions from it. Lack of focus also makes it much more difficult to design the interface and content hierarchy as the production team needs to create a product that appeals to everyone and therefore is not optimised for anyone.

Available features need to be closely aligned with your business goals. There is a phrase in tech startup culture that you may have heard of - MVP (Minimum Viable Product). This is a product with the minimum feature set that is developed as quickly and cheaply as possible in order to gather feedback from users before proceeding to refine, improve, and expand on the product. This way you're building something you know your users/customers can use and want to use.

Data drives business decisions and so the earlier you can collect data and the more data you can collect, the more successful the project will be for your business or organisation.

A web project requires **continued investment** in order to be successful. Until your project is launched you won't be able to learn anything about your real users or their behaviour. You won't be able to identify your project's strengths and weaknesses.

### What is it all for?

The web has so much potential, more so as the technology increasingly pervades into new environments and situations, impacting people's lives. It's always a shame when a website is silo'd into a small division of an organisation, just as when it's carved up among all divisions with no overall focus.

You don't just plant a garden because you have some seeds or because your neighbour has one. You should have in mind what kind of garden you want, what you want to use it for - growing crops or playing football? Admiring flowers or increasing privacy? etc.

A website isn't just a marketing tool, even if it falls under the remit of the marketing department of your organisation. It's a customer service tool. It's a representation of your organisation to your customers. So before you engage in a web project, think carefully about your goals and how the website or app can integrate with your organisation as a whole. You know your customers/users better than anyone so consider how to find out what they want and how you can give it to them using the web. You can rely on the technical expertise of your production team for this but ultimately it's you who must decide on the required features. Back to the garden analogy, what do you want to plant? Know the environment, decide what you want your team to plant, then plan how you're going to tend to the fruits of their labour.

### Don't be a copycat

No matter what your competitors are doing, there's no guarantee that they're doing it right. Your business is unique and has its own selling points which can be manifested in your online presence. Highlighting differences is increasingly important in an online world densely populated with almost identical websites and apps. Of course there are situations where consistency is desired - navigation patterns, the location of the logo or search box, etc. - and if your design is going to be drastically different from those of your competitors then it will need to be done well so as not to shock or confuse potential visitors. The visitors you want are your customers, not those of your competitors, so find out what they want and what they are expecting and build something specifically for them.

## Prepare your business

Being such an integral part of any business, a new web project will inevitably require organisational change to accommodate it. It's like opening a new shop or business division - you need people specifically responsible for it to drive its success. If you expanded your business in such a way but only assigned the same people who are already handling the other parts of the business then you can expect them to be spread too thinly and be unable to devote their full attention to either area of responsibility and the business will suffer as a result.

In this section we're talking about what roles are required within your organisation to ensure the project's continued success. Although we may refer to a “team”, these roles may just be one person (maybe you?) but it's still important to establish the roles and responsibilities required.

So aside from the production team, who will build and perhaps maintain the technical side of the project, your business or organisation will have an established set of roles dedicated to setting up the project and managing it going forward, creating and maintaining its content, and engaging customers online through various means including social media. The production team should have individual access to any and all stakeholders undertaking these roles - those responsible for making the decisions and those maintaining the content and engaging customers. The production team will need to understand how people within your organisation intend to work on the website or app and what they might want to use it for. A great production team may hold stakeholder interviews that could identify issues with your organisational structure that may hinder the project's success.

Indeed every part of your organisation needs not only to be involved in the planning of the web project from the start, but need to closely cooperate and coordinate their input. For instance if only the marketing department is involved then it could end up being nothing more than a customer acquisition platform or a stream of press releases. If another department wants to come in later with their own goals and make changes then your production team will have to find a way to hack the existing information architecture or navigation system in order to accommodate, resulting in a less than optimal product.

A web project demands leadership. There should be someone senior in your organisation for whom the project has their full attention and who can bring all departments and stakeholders together. That person has to be able to make executive decisions about how the project is built and managed, and take responsibility when things go wrong. This person is, by proxy, the digital representation of the organisation online and so it must be someone senior. The production team needs to be able to engage directly with this person in order to get quick feedback and decisions that will impact production. Maybe, if you're reading this chapter, that person is you?

Therefore you need some kind of decision-making structure in place so that you can provide the production team with what they need. Likewise you need to be able to demand from your production team the data or information you need to make those decisions.

So you will need to establish a leadership person in your organisation who is solely responsible for setting up and then maintaining the website as part of the business. As a representation of your organisation, it's important that the website maintains a consistent tone and personality that matches your real-world organisation. This can't be done if everyone in your organisation is making changes or posting content haphazardly, so you may need to delegate a dedicated person or team.

### Your internal team

As stated in the first chapter, a website or web app is ultimately a way of delivering content to people via the web. You therefore need to prioritise content above all else and establish a set of guidelines for content production and maintenance - what will be the tone/style of the language used, when and how content will be added and removed, who is responsibile for content, etc. Having guidelines will ensure that new people joining your organisation will be able to seamlessly maintain the project.

Content maintainers need to be specialists, and that's why there is a whole chapter in this book about content management. Content for the web is different to that on other media because the way people engage with the web is different - skim-reading, tapping, clicking, swiping, pinching, uploading, downloading etc. You're dealing with fast interactions and short attention spans. For instance the text you write in a physical brochure would look ridiculous on a website and would be unlikely to perform its function as well.

You may have heard of a tool called a “Content Management System”, or CMS for short. Examples include Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla, ExpressionEngine, Sitecore, Umbraco, Ghost, Perch etc. CMS's allow anyone with access to log in and change your website's content. Unfortunately a tool such as this isn't going to solve your content problems. A CMS will have more features than you need, as it's not focused specifically for your content, and be difficult to use. You still need a dedicated team of specialists who are not only trained in writing web copy and copy specifically for your organisation, but who are also trained in using any tools (such as a CMS) and procedures that you have established. These people will be able to maintain the quality, consistency, and relevancy of the content and will likely not forget how to use those tools and procedures because they use them on a regular basis. They will be able to more easily remember too what content is currently live and what needs to be changed or removed. In the long term, having dedicated content people will optimise your return on investment because your users will always be more engaged and you will spend less on things like repeated CMS training or content consultants to periodically come in and resolve issues for you.

Depending on the size of your project, you may need lots of people to maintain content or you may need just one. What's important though is that there's one person ultimately responsible for maintaining control of content or overseeing the content team. Policies should be put in place that dictate who has access to the CMS, what the tone and style of copy should be, what kind of media can be uploaded, etc. These policies would make up a **content style guide** (_see Appendix B - Content Styleguide_) and helps by putting your audience first, encouraging consistency and good practice, and creates better content.

Aside from producing content in-house, you may even want to handle the entire production internally as well. If your website or application is business critical and you have sufficient resources at hand, you may consider it unwise to hire an outside production team. The current trend is that many companies are building internal teams to take on production roles, which may be more cost-effective as well as strategically wise. This is forcing many “traditional” website agencies to become squeezed and downsize. There will always be work for specialist contractors but they will come at a cost and be more suitable for short-term projects.

Perhaps you might not need a production team at all? If your requirements are basic, or common, enough then you may take advantage of another current trend - software as a service. The rise of SaaS is threatening the lower end of many sectors including accountancy and book-keeping, recruitment, customer management, even taxis. The web is no exception, as services like Squarespace are making it extremely easy for small businesses to get online quickly and cheaply using their stunning and surprisingly flexible templates. While several years ago, agencies could have relied on the income from building custom content management systems, today it would be madness. Likewise services like Shopify or Stripe mean developers no longer need to build e-commerce or online payment systems. These services are specifically aimed at simplifying and automating work that would usually require a small team of highly skilled, and therefore expensive, people. In automating such work, they can avoid repetition, increase efficiency, and focus on consistent high-quality solutions that will make your life easier and save you money. By establishing early what you need to produce, i.e. the scope of your project, you can identify the skills and services required, and assess whether they can be bought cheaply and easily online.

### Customer Service

The web empowers customers. The way people interact with you online is totally different to any real-world scenario. They skim-read, have short attention spans, small screens in which their attention must be focused and guided. What's more they can contact you, share your content, post reviews and run to your competition with just a few clicks or taps. They themselves have an audience of family and friends and are aware of the power this gives them in being able to control their relationship with you and your organisation because they can share and talk about you and what you're offering. Online communication is instant. If a customer makes contact with you on social media then there is an impetus to respond quickly. With so many great websites and apps out there, whatever your digital presence you have will inevitably be compared with your competition, and not just with your competition but with any other online website or app. That means consumers have high expectations not just in terms of features and usability but also performance and, ultimately, customer service. People using Google all the time may be disappointed when using a website that isn't as fast, pretty, useful, or friendly as Google. How many times have you yourself been frustrated when trying to fill out a form or get help with some online service?

This all highlights that customer service is an extremely important part of any web project. Part of customer service is also gathering feedback and the web makes it tremendously easy for your customers to reach you.

One of the primary ways users contact web project owners is via Social Media. No matter whether you yourself are personally a big user of social media, it's something that should be taken seriously when engaging in any kind of web project. Your web project is likely not your organisation's only online presence and so you can leverage social media profiles to maximise your project's reach and engagement.

Again, like with content, this has to be handled responsibly. Someone should be charged with being your social media voice, maintaining the same consistent tone and style across the board. This person should make use of knowledge about your users to find ways to engage them across different channels. Like with content, if anyone in your organisation could represent you on social media then this engagement wouldn't be focused and the style wouldn't be consistent. There is the added risk that your social media channels may just end up being a boring list of company announcements or press releases.

Ultimately, your organisation has to be aware of its overall customer/user experience both on and offline. If you have a great product or service offline then users of your website will expect the same quality standard online. Similarly, if you have a great website or app then you will also need to be great at social media and offline customer service to ensure overall success, for if people dislike the service they receive offline, they're probably less likely to return to your website no matter how great it is.

## Know your users/customers

Your web project needs to target a specific set of the population. You need to learn about them and understand their behaviour in order to make your project appeal to them specifically. So before you can learn about them, you need to find out who they are.

### Find out who they are

You need to filter out and focus on people who are relevant to your project. Maybe you already have an offline business with existing customers, but your online customers will be different so traditional market segmentation techniques might be helpful, or otherwise you could try running surveys on social media networks or by studying the web projects of successful competitors. If you have the time and resources you could even build a prototype and observe real users as they interact with it.

A major consideration is the age and physical capabilities of your users, as well as their cultural background, as that may affect how the text is displayed or how features are designed. Similarly you might want to think about how your audience demographic influences what devices your users might use to interface with your web project. A young audience in a developed country can be expected to have a large percentage of users on smart phones. Older people or people in developing countries may generally use older desktop computers and operating systems, or text-only phones.

Note that any surveys or questions you ask potential users need to be constrained in a way that you record the same information from everyone. By putting together a list of such questions, it will help you to focus on what exactly you need to know about your users. You have limited time so try to think about your knowledge gaps and what information would be most advantageous, as well as which details would best inform design decisions your production team will be required to make.

Remember to ask open-ended questions that encourage people to share as much as possible. If you are testing users in front of a live product then ask them to demonstrate their experience and difficulties. Ask them to explain their experiences with competitor organisations.

The objective here is to gain a fundemental understanding of potential users, not to be exhaustive. From this basic information your production team should be able to extrapolate more details later. By gathering this information about your potential users, the users are by proxy involved in the project's design and build process.

The user data you've collected will form representations of various types of user that your production team can use. These representations are called _“personas”_.

### Developing personas

For each persona, create a document that your production team may reference. By all means personalise the personas - give them names and make them sound like real, interesting people. Maybe even provide photos and personal naratives for each persona? You are sharing with your team the knowledge you have about your potential users and so it needs to be engaging; those potential users need to constantly be in the minds of your designers and developers to ensure that what they are creating is going to be exactly what your users will want. Of course, it's up to you whether you want to hire an outside agency or consultant to do this for you. Each persona document should have the following sections:

* **Overview**

  A brief and personal description of the person, including their name, age, profession, where they live etc. or any other basic details that may be relevant in the context of the project.


* **Domain knowledge**

  What is their level of expertise? How much do they know about your product or service and how adept at they at using the technology that you will use?


* **Goals**

  What are they hoping to achieve when using your website or app?


* **Attitudes and motivations**

  Why are they choosing to enage with your website or app? Why not competitors? Are they also engaging with competitors? What do they think about your organisation and your competitors?


* **Processes**

  What tasks are they carrying out when using your website or app?


* **Environment**

  When where and how are they using your website or app?


* **Pain points**

  What might they find challenging about engaging with your website or app? What have they found difficult about using competitors' websites or apps?


* **Tools and technology**

  Are they using a desktop computer? smart phone? tablet? TV?


* **Relationships and social structure**

  Who are their friends and family? Are they on social media? What is their community reach?


* **The future**

  What kind of user are they likely to become? Will they want more? Will they always return to your website or app to perform the same actions? Will they be a return user or use your website or app as a one-off?

## State your goals

Now you know what your users will want, what their goals are, what are _you_ going to give them? What are _your_ business or organisational objectives?

You should create a document for your production team that introduces your business, its strengths and weaknesses, its personality. You need to convey precisely why you need this web project, what is its purpose, who will use it.

It's a good idea to keep goals as few and as concise as possible. Focus on a maximum of two or three primary objectives. If you find you have more than three, then create another list of secondary objectives that could be the focus of future features and updates.

When stating goals, be explicit, declarative and use clear and simple language, no business jargon, acronyms, or anything specific to your business that your production team may be unfamiliar with. For example:

* **GOOD**:
  * We will generate $XXXX in monthly revenue after 6 months of launch via online sales of all products
  * Provide an easy way for users to offer feedback about product X
  * Achieve 5000 active monthly users across all platforms and devices and a 15% conversion rate


* **BAD**:
  * Engage more consumers
  * Higlight company X's unique selling points and the superb customer service that makes us an industry leader in a fast-changing market, especially our “ROC” division
  * Allow people to navigate on mobile

Features are what your production team will be building. Not an overall website or app, and **not** just a collection of web pages. Each feature will require time and resources, so share and discuss your budget with your production team so that they know which features are feasible or which goals they may need to focus more on. Remember that once your project is built with its minimum feature set, you can always improve and expand on the feature set later when you have more money to spend.

Another benefit of explicitly stating your goals is that you don't have to constantly interfere with the production team's deliverables. Remember also to consult all the stakeholders in your organisation who may have their own requirements for your web project. If you neglect them they may need to add to the scope later down the line, and their requirements may conflict with yours or others'. You can avoid the dreaded "scope creep" because you've been forced to consider first exactly what your organisation wants from the start rather than thinking of ideas for new features as you go along. By all means, make a note of any new ideas, but save them for another phase of the project.

The goal of the production team is to produce something that meets both user needs and your business goals. Information about your business provides them with the necessary constraints within which to work. So it's important that you provide them as much insight as possible about your business and what you are expecting them to build.

## Set expectations

Beyond your business goals, you should have a clear idea of what you're trying to achieve and what your measures of success wil be. You may have heard of phrases like KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) or OKRs (Objective Key Results), popularised by companies like Google and Intel. Another similar concept is S.M.A.R.T. criteria:

* Specific
* Measureable
* Assignable
* Realistic
* Time-related

The idea is that each person or team sets their major objectives and quantifiable actions required to achieve them. By setting quantifiable measures of success, people become accountable. It also serves as a communication tool so that everyone involved in the project understands both their own scope of work and also what others are required to do. Therefore it's highly valuable to set expectations about the project management process, the design, functionality, and timescales.

In your initial meetings with or spec document for your production team, you should outline the following:

* how you expect them to handle communication with you, when they will provide updates, and when and how you will contact them with requirements and feedback
* what kind of design style or theme you're hoping for, what you like or dislike about your competitors' styles and themes
* what specific features or functionality you need them to produce
* any hard deadlines you may have for certain features
* how you will measure success of the product they build - e.g. site visits, customer acquisition rate, revenue etc.

For an example of a requirements document to pass to your production team, please see _**Appendix A** - Requirements Document_.

Remember that documentation is all well and good, but face-to-face meetings or telephone calls - as many or as few as required until you're confident that a mutual understanding has been established - are helpful to reinforce your requirements and strengthen your relationship with your production team.

## Leave it to the experts

Now that you've passed on your requirements and expectations, it's time to let your production team get to work.

### Give them what they need

Do they have everything they need? The first step in their design and planning process is information architecture. This means **content**. You need to provide them with all the content that your site or app needs to feature **before** they can start. They may be able to work with you to produce this if they have a dedicated content manager or copywriting team. However it's a great opportunity for the person in your team who will be responsible for _maintaining_ the site or app once it's live to take charge.

Maybe your organisation or business already has promotional material with copy that you intend to use. But online copy is different and has to be taylored for the web, in which case it may be useful to try and categorise your copy requirements and re-write it from scratch. Copy-writing is covered in _Chapter 7: Content Managers_.

What is important though is that you have real copy for your production team to get started with. If you make them start without copy, due to deadlines that you yourself have imposed, then they will be forced to use placeholder content and their design will be unrealistic and not representative of the final product. They will have to hack it later to accommodate the final content, which will invariably create unforseen problems and make for a lot more work for everyone. They may even charge you extra for the additional time and effort required to make the necessary design and technical changes. In a worst-case scenario, they will just replace the placeholder content directly and fudge your final content into place without making any of the necessary changes or adjustments. The result may be ugly, broken, or unusable, or at best less than optimal, and you will only have yourself to blame.

When it comes to content, what parts of your organisation need to be represented? This will inform the design of the structure and navigation. Do you require additional language translations? This will inform the technical architecture. What kind of media will be featured? Images? Videos? Tabular data or charts? Animations or illustrations? For all your media requirements you should at least be able to provide the team with example or placeholder media if you don't already have media prepared.

### Don't micro-manage

Unless you're single-handedly covering all the roles involved in producing a web-project yourself, you're working with other people who have their own responsibilities, skills, and expertise. Maybe you're paying them to work on your project, be it an internal team in your organisation or an outside agency. Either way you need to let them do their jobs. It's not within the scope of your role to do the day-to-day project management, make design decisions, or interfere in technology choices. Your production team are the experts so give them detailed requirements and then leave them to it - that's what they're there for.

You also need to listen to them. Chances are they know more than you do about web design and technology so heed their advice and listen to their concerns; it's all part of their service. Continue to support them by providing them with anything they might request in order to do their jobs, be it requirement details, content, feedback, or time. Of course, if you disagree with them on any point or are unable to meet their requests, then you should ask them for clarification and explanation, and come to a mutual agreement. Similarly, if you don't understand a particular design or technology decision then ask them to explain and discuss it with them. Perhaps you will agree with them, or perhaps you may find an angle to convince them of the merits of your own ideas or preferences.

### Avoid design by committee

The worst thing you or your team can do is enforce arbitrary decisions on your production team. That will leave them resentful, feeling their skills and ideas are unappreciated and unvalued, and less likely to happily accommodate further requests. If you do have a committee of stakeholders that need to be informed of the production team's progress then make sure they are all presented with the ideas at the same time in the same meeting. If this arrangement cannot be made - perhaps all stakeholders are not in the same location - then a great idea is to ask your production team to prepare some sort of presentation, perhaps a video, explaining their decisions openly and clearly. This forces the production team to think about what they want to communicate to you. Feedback, however, should be passed onto the production team individually. If in that meeting all feedback is laid out on the table then there will be pressure to reach some consensus, making those unwanted arbitrary decisions to try and resolve problems on the fly. It will be easier for your production team to gather and organise everyone's feedback separately so that they can make their own informed expert decisions. Ultimately, as the project owner, you are responsible for approving these decisions. Your role will be undermined if your team or committee end up being the ones responsible. If the decision turns out to be incorrect, who is still responsible for remedying it? You are.

### Timelines & deadlines

This is always a point of contention in any client-agency or owner-producer relationship. When is what going to be done? Maybe you have a hard deadline, such as a holiday promotion or product launch by which date your web project much have reached some stage of completion. However **you cannot set deadlines or timelines**. Don't panic.

By all means communicate your internal deadlines to your production team. Hopefully you've kicked off the project with enough time to produce the required features. Ultimately, it's up to the production team to determine how long features will take to produce and what features can be completed within what timelines. Everyone works differently and only the people undertaking the hard work, the copywriters, designers and developers, will really be able to estimate the time required. Depending on the complexity of the required features, it may be very difficult, if not impossible, to make such an estimation. Every web project always encounters unexpected problems and delays, such as unconsidered design scenarios or coding bugs, which a good production team must take into account.

If your production team always agrees to any deadline, or agrees to an overall final deadline for a large, complex project, or if they present you with an hourly breakdown for work yet to be planned let alone begun, then this is a **bad** sign. Either they're lying to you or they're consigning themselves to overtime and corner-cutting in order to try and stick to an unreasonable timeline. This is going to be an unhappy, and unmotivated team and the end result is not going to be their best work. A good production team will break features down into smaller more manageable tasks, the timing of which can be more easily estimated. They will give themselves enough time so that each feature can be worked on until it's perfect, rather than building whatever they can in the time available.

You may find it difficult to relinquish control over the timing, and therefore possibly the cost, but with a good relationship and a fixed communication schedule you will be able to monitor progress to ensure that the agreed features are being built within an agreed timeline and budget. Therefore, expect timelines to be established late in the planning phase of a project, once all required features have been thought through and planned properly, and expect deadlines to be flexible.

## Useful feedback

Once production has begun, you are going to need to provide constant feedback on the team's work.

Remember that they are the experts and you're tasking them to use their expertise to make decisions about design and technology. They may have fragile egos, they may be proud of their work, or they may see your project as a learning exercise or ground for experimentation, which is fine and to be expected. Therefore feedback must be constructive and must be delivered delicately, but at the same time it's your project and you need to ensure you're getting what you want (and maybe what you're paying for!).

There are countless jokes and memes about website owners and clients making arbitrary design decisions or dictating functionality:
* "make it pop"
* "make the logo bigger"
* "put that section above the fold"
* "make it more blue"
* "I don't like green"
* "make it open in a new window"
* etc.

Feeback like that is going to make your designers and developers mash their faces into their keyboards. You may feel the need to assert your authority or ownership over the project and thus demand changes that suit your personal preferences. There is a risk that your personal preferences don't align with those of the general online audience, just as there is the same risk that the designer's personal preferences also don't align with those your customers/users. All too often website owners are given high-fidelity designs and just asked "what do you think?". Maybe they're given a choice of 2 or 3 options, with a client manager asking "do you like that?", "how about this one?". This forces you to make arbitrary choices based on personal preferences, rather than informed decisions, and it's important not to fall into this trap. For this reason you should establish from the outset with your production team how you would like to be presented work and how you will provide feedback. A good production team will offer one set of work alongside the original objectives with an explanation of their design and technology decisions. If they don't, demand this of them. If they're offering you choices, they're basically reflecting the expert decicions back to you and that's not your role. It suggests they are not confident or competent.

Feedback needs to be precise and constructive. It's easier to give such feedback when you have precise objectives by which to assess the work.

> **BAD**: Do you think this looks good?

> **GOOD**: to what extent do you think feature A meets objective B?

Just as the production team needs to explain their decisions, you need to explain why you like or dislike the work they've produced. If you disagree with any of the decisions they've made, ask them for more explanation or for data that justifies their decisions. If they cannot justify their decision then you need to hold them to account. Keep your business goals in mind and make sure they are being met.

You also need to be able to offer feedback on real tactile prototypes. In the early stage of the project it's ok if the design isn't polished, what's important is functionality and usability. Demand of your production team show you interactive prototypes so that the difficult problems can be tested early on. If they're showing you high-fidelity images, essentially just pictures of a website or app, then it doesn't accurately reflect the end product and so you have no way of offering genuine feedback.

Finally, don't be afraid of offering feedback, even if you're just making really small, seemingly minor points. Often by being outside of the production process you have the advantage of having a fresh set of eyes, which can be extremely valuable. Similarly, don't give into frustration if your production team decides to ignore your feedback. Again, you can ask them to explain - it could be that what you are asking for is not feasible from a technical perspective or may adversely affect the user experience. Remember, they're the experts and they need to have both user goals and your business goals in mind.

## Gathering Data

The final part of your role is to gather data by which to measure success against your stated goals and expectations. For this you need to have a plan in place and assign responsibility for how this data is going to be gathered. We're not talking about collecting personal data about your users here, unless of course it's somehow necessary to refine your website's usability - marketing departments are all too often eager to make users fill out long and unweildy forms, collecting their postal addresses, favourite colour, brand consumption habits etc. etc., at the expense of alienating potential customers. Any data you collect about your users should be immediately useful to your web team in a clear and tangible way.

At all stages of the project, during production and after release throughout the project lifetime, you should continuously measure how well the service is working for your users. You need to have a way of monitoring and recording user behaviour in real time. A common tool for doing this is Google Analytics, which can be integrated into any website or application, although there are alternatives. Establish with your production team how feedback and monitoring tools can be integrated with the project.

Someone in your organisation should be responsible for watching these metrics to proactively identify and react to potential issues and areas for improvement. This will also highlight which areas of the project should be prioritised.

In addition to automated tools, you should have a mechanism in place for users to offer direct feedback. This may be an online survey, social media platform, a contact form or even just an email address so that users can get in touch. App stores usually have their own feedback and rating system which you can put to good use. Remember that your web project is a form of customer service as much as anything else so you need to think about how you can measure customer/user satisfaction.

As part of your ongoing investment, the web project should be continuously maintained. Decisions about how to maintain it - the content, the design, and the technology - should be driven by data.
