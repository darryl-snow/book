## Personal Management

No matter what role you play in any organisation, you will always have to manage people, even if it's just yourself. Your boss or client may have their own management style, and the way your colleagues or team-mates manage themselves may be different to your own methods. Essentially though, all types of management have the same common tenants:
* Set goals
* Plan how to achieve goals
* Measure whether goals have been met
* Repeat

When managing your own tasks, most of this may be subconcious - you probably just know what you need to do and you do it without giving it much thought, much less frantically maintaining written lists. When it comes to your personal career goals you may take advice from Jack Welch, manager of the last century according to Fortune Magazine. He said that you should work hard, strive to impress your boss by over-achieving - the 'be the first one in and the last one out' mentality. After seeing your work hard year after year you'll be entitled to the promotions and pay increases, right? Just work hard and you'll get there eventually. James Whittaker, of Google and then Microsoft, debunked this theory in a blog post in 2014.

> This is at best like a placebo to make you feel like you're being proactive in managing your career, and, at worse, a slow poison that will prolong your servitude to the corporate machine. Working hard only makes you stand out when you are the only one doing it. Everyone who gets ahead works hard. It is not a strategy; it’s table stakes.

> -_James Whittaker_

James goes on to point out that this strategy will leave you overworked, stressed, and ultimately underacheived. Instead of focusing just on what will make your immediate suprvisor pleased with your effort, focus on **your goals** and how you can do something that will **add value** to both yourself and your organisation. Your personal success is dependent only on yourself, and the web already gives you more power to find work and learn new skills such that you no longer need to rely on a boss or mentor to help you along.

## Adding Value

This, simply put, means getting better at what you do by improving the quality or your work and the depth of your skills. If you can do more and do it better then you are worth more to any organisation. Again, quoting Jack Whittaker, _“Like the person you report to, the company you work for has never mattered less.”_. Focus on what you enjoy doing and what you are best at and set as your personal goal ways to improve. If you find you are not improving, then think about why. Are you being challenged? Are you being supported? Are you managing your relationships in a way that offers you both support and challenges? Success doesn't come easy, and it's up to you to ensure that your career is not just successful but also enjoyable. If in this industry you find yourself doing exactly the same thing from year to year then it's doing nothing for your sense of self-worth, let alone your professional value.

## Learning

The most important skill of a web professional is the ability to learn new skills. It's vital to realise that this is an industry that's constantly changing. In fact that's why web projects are so complicated - it's all based on a document format from the 1980s designed for the easy sharing and linking of scientific papers. The protocols and technologies have gradually been thrown together to support whatever is already just around the corner. Computer scientists working on the nascent web would not have been thinking about e-commerce, mobile, social media. These things today are now, just 20 years later, a pillar of almost every business and industry.

That means that your skills, as a web professional, are in increasing demand. However it also means that your skills increasingly face more competition as the industry rapidly expands. New technologies, libraries, techniques, and platforms are released literally every day. It's therefore vital that we be aware of not just the current state of the web but also what's on the horizon. But change is scary. There's the ever-present risk that we, or those we work with, will just continue doing the same work, to the same standards, by the same methods. Of course when it comes to technology choices for a web project we have to consider what's appropriate, but in order to make an informed choice we must first learn what technologies are available. It's not just technology either, choices are to be made when it comes to project management, design, testing, and so on.

The truly awesome news, and it really is awesome in the true sense of the word, is that one can in just a few clicks and taps of the keyboard access all of the industry information there is. By setting aside some time every day or every week to study the growing mountain of online resources then you are increasing your value. In fact by not doing this you are decreasing your value, as value is measured against your industry peers. Find websites, blogs, podcasts, magazines, and conferences that promote information about your area of focus. You may find it helpful to use some kind of app or service to save articles and read offline at your leisure.

It can of course be quite overwhelming. You need to manage your time and resources in a way that you benefit from the learning material in a tangible way. An article about a new JavaScript library may be very interesting, but unless you're going to put it into practice and commit it to memory then your time may be better spent reading something else.

It's a singular phenomenon that in this industry people are so keen to share what they know. Perhaps it's because the career of every single web professional has at some stage benefitted from such free online information or resource, whether it be an open-source library or a podcast or a popular blog. Thus people have an ingrained sense of this intellectual philanthropy and are encouraged to give something back to the community. I think Dave Rupert put it best when he said he could never imagine a situation where's he's sitting in his rocking chair in his 80's, wagging his finger at his great grandchildren, and rasping...

_“Don't make my mistake, don't share what you know!”_

## Teaching

By sharing your knowledge and skills with others you are in fact increasing your competitiveness and adding value. Not only do you become a respected authority, but teaching also reinforces your knowledge, helps you to understand it better yourself, and perhaps branches new areas of interest. Chris Coyier began his CSS-tricks blog not as a foremost expert on CSS by his own admission, but in writing and maintaining it has indeed become one, and a world-renowned one at that.

Therefore in addition to learning resources, some of your time could perhaps also be put towards a personal or company blog, seminar or conference talks, and workshops. If you've found and played around with a new library or piece of software, then show someone else. If you've solved a problem that you often face in your work then write about it and put it online. You'll be making the web a better place!

## Working with others

The second most important skill of any web worker is listening. Successful web projects require a wide range of skills and roles to put together and, no matter how good you think you are, you probably don't have all of them. At the very least, you don't enjoy all of those roles or would rather focus your energy on the subset that you do enjoy or are stronger at.

Therefore, you're going to need to work closely with others; you cannot work in isolation. If if you're an independent freelancer or working on your own startup, you'll still need to interact with clients or testers and garner useful feedback, even engage with others online for information about tools or technologies. It's important that you establish from the outset how this cooperation and collaboration is going to be achieved. Rather than be at the whim of a team leader or project manager, this is something that all team members should be involved in establishing. Every individual and therefore every team have their own strengths, weaknesses, and preferences. By establishing project rules democratically for each team, members have a stronger sense of ownership in the project and more confidence in how it will be managed.

#### Documentation

It's important that you write down any and all information that may be useful to others. Whether that be project scope, meeting minutes, design decisions, timelines, technical issues etc. This documentation should be in a consistent and easily shareable format that must be agreed before the start of the project.

#### Communication

Of course you need to be able to explain and discuss ideas to those you're working with. This may be primarily through email or instant messanger, or equivalent online service, but it's still vital to have regular face-to-face or at the very least phone discussions. A quick chat can often resolve issues and cultivate better relationships as well as save time. Hiding behind a screen at your desk isn't going to help anyone nor benefit the project. This is especially important for senior members of the team who must lead by example.

Non-distributed teams should at least sit nearby eachother and always schedule regular meetings to provide updates and raise issues. Face-to-face meetings or even phone calls make it much easier and faster to iterate on ideas. If you are working in a large agency with plenty of desks and plug sockets then have the people who are working together sit together. Otherwise there's a risk team members may stick to their own desks and ignore eachother, reluctantly shooting off emails only when they need something. Proximity fosters frequent communication and encourages team integrity by offering more opportunity to get to know other team members and how they work.

Distributed teams can simulate proximity by using some sort of communication tool, even if it's an IRC chatroom. Just knowing that your team members are just a few taps away encourages frequent contact and makes their presence felt.

Generally speaking, the more communication the better; however, certain tasks, particularly those creative tasks like designing and developing, or juggling multiple projects, require extended periods of concentration which should not be disrupted. Therefore meetings should be scheduled as frequently and as seldom as required.

#### Scope, Schedules & Timelines

While a web project should never have a fixed timeline or end date, it's important to agree on and set minor milestones for the project tasks. This will be discussed more in the _Project Management_ chapter but you need to establish early who will do what when. These schedules need to be monitored and maintained on a daily basis in order for a team to successfully collaborate.

#### Conflict Resolution

What will you do when someone doesn't meet their deadline? Or when you realise that something needs to be changed or re-done unexpectedly? How do you plan to maintain the pace and motivation for the rest of the team? And what about if two or more people are having trouble working together? These situations are all too common and a plan must be in place to deal with it. This responsibility usually falls under the scope of the team leader role and will be discussed in a later chapter, but it something that all team members should be made aware of and discuss before the project starts.

If you sense a conflict with someone else, then try to recognise their strengths and weaknesses and how you might adjust your relationship or work approach to accommodate them in some way. If you ignore it then the project will suffer as a result as you become increasingly frustrated with the person and by proxy the project itself. A classic example is the designer/developer conflict:

> The designer enjoys browsing showcase websites and magazines and wants to achieve radical new layouts. They work with their own toolsets, perhaps a graphic design software suite, and have no knowledge of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the developer's toolbelt. They may eventually produce a stunning design and pass over a huge and software-specific graphics file to their coding counterpart then put their feet up.

> The developer, upon seeing the “design”, goes mental. It can't be done using the front-end framework they've already selected. They resign to hack something together that looks close to, but not exactly like the image they were sent.

The designer sees the developer as incompetent or lazy, unable or willing to complete the work. The developer sees the designer as incompetent and lazy, ignorant of the medium they're working in and unwilling to learn more about the technology constraints. The result is a project that doesn't look as good as the designer's idea, doesn't perform as well as the developer planned, and everyone is unhappy. The designer and developer resent eachother and will continue to resent working together on future projects.

The solution in this case is of course to establish at the start the working methodology, performance considerations, technology frameworks, and work together more closely. An iterative design approach where each module/component/section can be designed, developed, and tested simultaneously means the small technical problems can be identified and resolved before they snowball in to bigger, more personal problems. So maybe if you're experiencing such conflicts you may need to adjust the way you work to make it easier for others to work with you, and hopefully they will do the same.

## Do people even need to be managed?

The web is a global and open platform. Web professionals have everything at their fingertips - all the resources we need are online. We are paid relatively well, have fairly good benefits, and can work from anywhere with an internet connection.

Many progressive web companies have transformed the relationship between the manager and the managed and it's fast becoming an industry standard. At Google for instance, employees are encouraged to move from project to project every 18 months. That means they also get new managers to work with and so their managers have less influence over their future work and career path.

Paul Boag reminds us that the idea of a manager originates from the 18th and 19th centuries, the industrial revolution factory floors where work was tiring and monotonous and low-skilled, low-paid people needed to be “managed”. A manager was needed to make sure everyone just kept going without jeopardising production output or quality. On into the 20th century managers saw their role as telling people exactly what to do, watching or overseeing them, monitoring their exact hours, etc.

These days managers have simply become people with additional responsibility and administrative tasks. The best managers are enablers, recognising how best to increase the productivity of each and every person in the team. Web workers are highly skilled and motivated individuals. If you find yourself in the position of managing others then perhaps the best way to enable them is to trust that they will put their skills and motivation to good use as they see fit.

## Embracing Change

The web still somehow feels young. Indeed it's a young industry staffed by people in their teens, twenties, and thirties. To those of us who are in this industry, the web's increasing important and the parallel growing importance of non-desktop devices has seemed obvious for over a decade. And yet, we still see businesses, even whole industries - music, photography, journalism for example - struggling if not outright failing to consider the web's impact on their consumers and adapt their business strategies accordingly. According to a recent mobile commerce report at the time of writing, only 60% of the top 100 global retailers have a dedicated mobile website, and only 9 of them have a responsively designed website. This, 4 years after responsive design became an industry standard and while 58% of mobile retailer dollars going to the top 500 mobile retailers are coming from the mobile web (as opposed to in-app purchases), is surely astounding? But are we actually the ones responsible? Is it the remit of the business leaders to drive these changes or the experts, the web professionals, us? Are we set in our ways? Or are we simply maintaining the status quo, safe in the knowledge that skills like ours are in increasing demand, relieving us of the motivation to change the way we work?

We must stay aware of industry-wide trends and how they may affect our own roles. Such trends include how web teams work together, workflow and project management techniques, design and coding tools, even the very nature of websites themselves. So many web teams still work on a waterfall model, with designers and developers working independently of eachother. Many designers still use tools like Photoshop despite is proven ineffectiveness and inefficiency for producing responsive websites. We still largely ignore content, accessibility, rich media, and the fact that users have so much data at their fingertips that they may not even need what you were planning to build?

Whether you consider your role relatively minor or not, the daunting responsibility to maintain this overall view on the industry and keep up with all the latest trends perhaps makes you feel a little overwhelmed or despondent. It shouldn't. Your role is important and it is going to change thoroughly throughout your career. Perhaps it will change from year to year, or less. Change is only painful if you're not prepared for it: the day you fight with another team member about the right way to do something, or when your job is threatened because you're made to use a tool or technique that you're not absolutely comfortable with. The web is continuing to evolve and that's what's so exciting about working in the web industry. Embrace your changing role and you'll probably enjoy it a lot more and be rewarded with greater success.

## Health & Happiness

Passion leads to great web projects. The passion of every team member shines through on every successful app and website. That passion is so precious.

Almost all web professionals, by the very nature of the job, spend far too long sitting at a computer. Your humble author has the withered and feeble spinal column of a pensioner. Health has a huge impact on your overall happiness and therefore your passion.

Studies have shown that regular exercise releases endorphines and even encourages creativity. It's good for the brain. Maybe you think you don't have time to exercise but it doesn't always have to be time-consuming. Also bear in mind that you may find your productivity and efficiency increases. So find an exercise you enjoy - no point punishing yourself - and try and stick to an exercise schedule so that it becomes normalised in your general life, just as work is.

Whereas our modern lives are often lived from chair to chair, we evolved as a species squatting, standing, walking, and running. Our modern sendentary behaviour puts us at risk of heart disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer, and hypertension. You already know all this of course, and that exercise is crucial. But you don't have the time, right? And the weather's crap. And the gym is expensive and far away. So how about just standing at your desk instead? Get something to elevate your computer, find a comfortable way to type while standing, and voila - problem solved! A standing body uses energy differently than does a sedentary body. Recent studies have shown that we burn calories at a different rate and store them in different ways. Even brain function is affected with at least one experiment showing that high school students' test scores improved 20% when they were made to stand in class. There's a difference between exercising too little and sitting too much. Our brains become acclimatised such that we prefer sitting, but by getting up and becoming more active you encourage your body to want to move more. Standing's a lot easier than running, right? And you can do it _while_ you work, so no excuses! You may even find it provides not just health benefits but also productivity and creativity benefits too.

At the very least there are neck, back, and arm exercises you can do while at your desk - check on Youtube. Perhaps take 5 minutes every hour to do some simple yoga poses, some press-ups, sit-ups, or aerobic exercises. You may find the distraction clears your mind such that when you sit back down to work you can solve problems more easily.

Obviously you should also watch what you eat. This is no diet book but too many developers especially become enveloped in long coding sessions, which often means a diet of sugar and carbs - cheap, fast, easy, delicious sugar and carbs. Once they're “in the zone” meals are neglected or unhealthy snacks are forced into short breaks. Do try and plan some decent nutritious meals around your work time and take necessary breaks for the sake of your longterm productivity.

## Finding the right work

You know what you can do and what you want to do and only you can shape your career. Think about what kind of work you want to do then research what opportunities are out there. You could just browse job descriptions but even better would be to get in touch with people already doing the jobs you want to do for the kind of companies you want to work for. Reach out by email or social media and ask specific questions that will clarify what you need to do in order to get that kind of work. Maybe you are lacking in some skills or experience so that's what you need to focus on.

Try not to focus too much on a company's reputation. Especially big companies have numerous teams that all work in different ways on different kinds of projects. You'd be mistaken that just by joining such a company you'll be given the tasks or responsibilities that you crave or that it would surely be benefitial to your future career. Sure, a big-name always looks good on a CV but in future opportunities it might not help if you can't demonstrate your unique skills and experience or can't say you contributed directly on one of the company's more famous products.

You need to assess every opportunity careful in terms of your individual goals. That means your goals need to be clear and you need to be very critical of job descriptions. Look for signs that a job description has been hand-written for a particular position rather than based on a generic template. You also need to look for specific skill requirements that match your own skillset. If you don't have the required skills then you'll at least be able to demonstrate that you can learn them. Can you? Sure you can. Templates or insufficiently detailed job descriptions suggest the company has a poor HR who either don't know much about or don't care about the exact roles they're hiring for or what work is involved.

The great thing about the working with the web is that it's pretty low-risk these days. It's fairly easy to find work no matter where you live - if you don't live in a big city or tech hub then all you need is an internet connection and you can work remotely. You can afford to join a company and leave soon afterwards if you find it unsuitable. Just learn from the experience and try and think of ways to avoid making the same mistake again.

Another part of the job-search than you need to be particularly critical of is interviews. Remember that when invited for an interview you are interviewing the interviewer or the company just as much as they are interviewing you. Again, if you think the interview process is weak then it suggests that the company's HR is weak; they don't care much about who they hire and they've probably not hired the best people or the kind of people you want to work with and learn from. If they focus on your academic credentials, give you some crappy little test, or just ask you generic interview questions like “where do you see yourself in 10 years?”, “what are your strengths and weaknesses” etc., just walk away.



http://css-tricks.com/web-devvy-ways-practice-gratitude-empathy/

Have you seen THIS IS WATER? It's great. It's about choosing to think differently, especially when frustrated. I think about it all the time. For instance, every time someone cuts me off on the road, I assume they are rushing someone to the hospital. It doesn't always work, but it's nice when it does. And it's not just a trick, it's learning to think differently.


In a related vein, I've enjoyed attempting to practice gratitude the last few years. I have an app on my phone that bugs me to write something I was grateful for that day. Forcing yourself to look back on the day and be thankful for something is good for perspective. I'd love to link to some gratitude stuff, but everything seems to try and be selling something. I don't have any problem with selling things, that just isn't the vibe I'm after here. You don't have to buy anything to practice gratitude, it's about thinking differently.

In another related vein, I'm starting to think empathy really is one of the most valuable skills (if you can call it a skill) that you can have. If you can put yourself in another persons shoes, you can imagine what it's like to use the things you make. That gives you mad UX skills. It means you can write a damn fine support email. You can make a meeting worth having. You can communicate clearly, because you can imagine what it's like to receive that communication. I'm looking forward to reading this.

In yet another related vein, it would be hard to miss there are some problems in this world with gender. There are lots of problems in this world, this is one of them. I've been enjoying this book, leveling up my understanding of that.

I hope this isn't too preachy or anything. I'm just trying to get better at this stuff. It feels better. So with that wordy introduction, what can we do within our little web world to practice this stuff?

Read your emails, comments, and tweets back to yourself and imagine getting that yourself

Is it clear? Is it useful? Did you acknowledge and address everything other people were waiting for? Does it make the point you are most trying to make? If it's critical, were you able to convey that without rudeness? Does it feel like you?

Go the extra mile

The other day I was having problems with the articles on this site being saved to a third-party reading service correctly. Daniel Ryan copies one of the pages of this site over to his own server to test it. I didn't ask for that. I didn't hire him to do that. He just went the extra mile when I was asking for advice.

You can't do that every single time for every single situation, but you can when you can and people always notice.

Thank people that go the extra mile for you

Don't let that slip by. Being more thankful in general is a good goal, and these are big easy targets to start with. Don't rule out a gift. I recently learned that some people (apparently I'm not one of them) that really love getting gifts. It's like the ultimate way they feel appreciated.

Practice being critical without being a jerk

You don't have to like everything. But hopefully when you don't, it's for a reason that you can articulate. And you can explain that without it being a personal attack or petty insult.

Related: It's possible to take the high ground without being condescending.

Related: You can always stop being a jerk in an exchange even after you've started. Anger begets anger, kindness begets kindness.

Related: Being internally skeptical is healthy.

Do the crap-jobs

Like writing docs. Like taking a weekend shift. Like taking out the office trash. It's not about being taken advantage of or wasting time, it's about saying thanks by freeing up someone else's time.

Report bugs

I once took an all-day bus tour of some of the volcanoes in Costa Rica. How cool, right? Only guess what, it was rainy and foggy. We didn't see a single volcano. We drove around in the rain and occasionally got out, got wet, and got back on the bus. It was a pretty awful day. We would have had more fun and spent less money not going at all. But by the end, we all felt some camaraderie with everyone else on the tour, and even with the tour guide.

At the end of it, we were asked to fill out review cards. My friend Kevin left a critical review. I was like c'mmmmmonnnn, it's not their fault it was foggy and rainy. He was right though. His review wasn't rude, it was honest. While it wasn't their fault it was foggy and rainy, it was their fault that they took us on a full-day tour anyway with no back up plan. They didn't alter anything to make it more fun under the circumstances. If we all just left happy reviews, what motivation would they have to make it better?

In web development, you aren't showing empathy by not reporting bugs. You are showing empathy by reporting bugs.

Make reduced test cases

As a proprietor of some web forums and some open-source projects, I'm always amazed at how many threads would benefit from a reduced test case. When you're having a problem, it shows you value everyone else's time involved when you strip it down to the the minimum amount need to reproduce it. As a side benefit, a lot of times you'll solve the problem and learn something while doing it.

Contribute to open source

This is a broad statement that gets tossed around a lot. Because it's true. What better way to show gratitude than to contribute your time and smarts to something that a lot of people benefit from?

Get the paid version / Use the donate button

I would guess most businesses don't want sympathy-buys, but rather they want your money when they have been useful to you. For better or worse, freemium is a rather established standard for web products. Sometimes the only way to get traction is giving away as much usefulness as you can without going broke. Financial support is certainly a form of gratitude, whether it's signing up for a paid plan or sending in a donation to someone accepting them for their work.

Write in to support just to say thanks

Everyone I've known who excels at support has both tremendous empathy, but also a thick hide. They know they are encountering customers at their most frustrated and are in for some abuse.

Not only can you practice your empathy skills while dealing with customer support when you actually have a problem, you can reach out just to say thanks when you don't have a problem at all.
