# About This Book
The web is hard. For some of us it seems completely alien and impenetrable. Others have perhaps grown up with it and witnessed how it's changed the world, while others still have fully embraced it and incorporated it into their lives. The internet revolution, and surely it is a revolution, has brought about such rapid change in society - business and commerce, politics and journalism, social attitudes, recreation, etc. - that people have a hard time keeping up. And that's what this book is about - people.

People are constantly trying to explore new ways to exploit the web for their industry or sector of society, to make use of the available technology to do something that will have an impact. Building any website or web app involves a multitude of different expertise and processes and almost always involves people working together, whether it be a single entrepreneur making use of others' open-source software or a large agency producing corporate platforms.

One of the great things about working on the web is that it's so open and friendly. There are countless tools, frameworks, templates, libraries we can use to get started, as well as forums and reference sites where we can ask for help when we get stuck. Help is offered freely and enthusiastically by complete strangers from all over the world.

And yet, producing a really outstanding website or app is hard. You've got all those incredible resources online, you have a great idea, great designers, developers, project managers and any other people you might need but it can still go so terribly wrong. Why is that? Why do we still frequently struggle with such terrible online experiences when we've seen other websites and web apps do the same thing so well?

Perhaps it's the same reason as building projects going wrong - remaining incomplete, going over-budget, or failing safety inspections. Or like companies collapsing under the competition - think Kodak or Nokia with their abundant cash and resources and yet seemingly blind to or defenseless against the looming tide of new technology. These buildings and companies fail due to individual decisions and actions by individual people, or indeed perhaps the lack of them. A web project going wrong, or even not turning out the very best that it can, is less likely to be the result of sloppy design or poor implementation of the technology - those are easy to fix. It's likely to be an issue with the way people communicate, interact, and work together.

Working on the web brings communication and cooperation challenges that remain new to many of us and change quicker than we are comfortable with. All too often people with conflicting ideas about how to proceed dampen or crush the passion and motivation of others. Without everybody involved having a sense of ownership and valued contribution, the project's potential is doomed.

For example, maybe you've heard of or experienced the stereotypical feud between designers and developers, both sides gleering at the other in mutual derision and distrust, even bouts of carpal-tunnel fueled fury? And are all clients and managers feared and loathed in equal measure? Or maybe you've purchased services from an agency to work on your product and have been disappointed time after time, only to go back for more? Was this because the designers lacked the enthusiasm or the developers lacked the skills? Are you a developer tired of being asked to just code up arbitrary PSDs that you've been sent? Or a designer straining under the workload of producing hundreds of almost identical PSDs to represent each and every page or section of a website, and then after finally gaining approval painstaikingly witnessing a sloppy developer ignoring your finely honed layout?

Web professionals (especially developers?) often seem to have quite obsessive personalities. Maybe all of us are a bit obsessive, taking some things far too seriously. And we make mistakes. The best managers admit their mistakes. Take for instance two of the most important statesmen of the 20th Century, Winston Churchill and Mahatma Ghandi. Churchill was bitterly opposed to the Normandy landings. He looked back to the first world war, to the disasterous British landings at Galipoli and the Dardanelles, the 120,000 British soldiers that were lost, but following the successful invasion he said "I was wrong." Ghandi said "I make mistakes and when I do they are Himalayan in size". We can take comfort in these sayings.

Throughout this book we're going to look at all the roles involved in producing a web project and how they need to cooperate in order to avoid mistakes that may jeopardise the success of a web project. These roles do not necessarily relate to any particular job title; most often any job title is likely to cover various different roles. You might not fit exactly into one of those roles, or maybe you're single-handedly covering several of them yourself (bravo!). Either way, it's important to understand what's involved and how you can work with or perform the other roles more successfully. The ultimate goal is to bring people together in a way that can optimise the success of every web project and thus make the web a better place for all.

## What is a “Web Project”

Socrates tells us that the first thing to do in any intellectual endeavour is to define your terms. So what kind of projects are we talking about? For the purposes of this book, a web project is anything involving the production or maintenance of a website or web app. This could be a standalone website or app, or it could be a single component or page. It could even be a “back-end” system for serving data to the user interface. To further narrow it down, production and maintenance may include planning, design, implementation, and testing. A website or web app is a web-connected interface that can be accessed via an internet-enabled device; it may be used from inside a web browser, or from within a native mobile or desktop app. It may run on a laptop, a phone, a tablet, a wearable device, a piece of furniture, a vehicle, or anything that's connected to the internet. It's essentially a way of serving content to end users.

So using these definitions, a web project might include the following examples:

* An e-commerce website
* A dashboard interface
* A web services API
* A marketing minisite
* A hybrid iOS or Android app
* Content Management System (CMS) integration

This book does not aim to cover such projects as:

* Rebranding - logo design, stationary etc.
* Social media management
* Website analytics assessment
* Database management systems

A web project may also be described as a “digital” project, but “digital” is a horribly vague buzzword that surely originated from marketing departments and won't be used throughout the rest of this book. After all, we all know we're not talking about any analogue projects, the antithesis of digital. We're not talking about digital radio, digital watches, or digital microwave ovens. We're talking about **anything that encompasses or intersects the web, mobile, and social media**.

All web projects have goals or an overall purpose. Throughout the book we may refer to this as business goals or to the website's place in the context of a business or organisation. Whether it's a company website, an online shop, a product or marketing site, or a personal blog or portfolio, there is a business entity for which the web project is operating. In this context we may refer to “users” or “customers” interchangeably.

## Who this Book is For
This book is aimed at all stakeholders in any web project. If you're reading this, that probably means you!

We'll go through chapters which encompass a role or set of roles involved in a web project. You should obviously focus on roles that you may be involved in, although it's also important to understand the roles of others whom you may work with, especially if you are in a position of overall responsibility. The more you understand the roles of others, the more smoothly you will be able to work together. In all likeliness, any web professional will cover several of these roles simultaneously, so the topics covered should hopefully be applicable to independent freelancers, agencies, and in-house teams alike.

The roles are:

* **Website Owners**

 The primary stakeholder, the one who's idea or financing has brought about the creation of the web project, and who profits from the web project itself. This may be, for example, an entrepreneur or startup founder, a small business owner, or the marketing manager of a large company. Website owners know their business and their goals better than anyone and (hopefully) have a good idea of how exactly they want the web project to turn out in order to achieve those goals. As a website owner, you may not have the best understanding of the technology or processes that will bring your project about, but you must have a clear understanding of what you want, what your users/customers want, and what the project success criteria will be.


* **Production Directors**

 The secondary stakeholder, directors represent the production team, and are the ones who make production decisions, build teams, and profit from the production of web projects. If you're in this position, then you must be intimately aware of and involved in everything that your team is doing. The ultimate success of the project falls on decisions made and processes instigated by you and you must take responsibility.


* **Client Managers**

 The interface between the website owner and everyone else, channelling communication both ways. Startups and in-house teams may not necessarily have this role, but agencies and freelancers do. This role covers not just communication but also any formal agreements between stakeholders. The client manager represents the primary stakeholder within the production team and must ensure that the goals are being constantly met and communicated.


* **Project Managers**

 Like a foreman on a building site, the project manager coordinates decisions about workflow and tools, coordinates communication, and monitors and maintains project progress. As a project manager, you've undoubtedly got the most to think about and the most work to juggle. You must also make production decisions that will affect everyone in the team.


* **Content Managers**

 All web projects have content. The very essence of any web project is its content. Content managers determine what that content should be and how it should be presented to the end users. This is an often forgotten or under-emphasised role and but web professionals are increasingly coming to realise the importance of having dedicated people responsible for content. Content managers are also responsible for maintaining content throughout the project's lifetime, making this the most significant role for ongoing success.


* **Designers**

 People involved in determining how the web project should look, feel, and behave when presented to the end user. The scope of tasks and responsibilities for this role is perhaps narrower compared to other roles, but these tasks and responsibilities are also the most difficult. A web designer has a multitude of constraints that they have to work within while also flexing their creativity.


* **Developers**

 Code monkeys. Only kidding. The developers are the ones who build the structure of the web project and write the code that performs the main functionality. Developers must also agree on the technology that will be used in the project implementation. A major factor in managing the development of a project is ensuring that other developers can seamlessly join and continue work on the project both now and in the future. This role requires highly focused expertise and years of accumulated knowledge and experience. Developers also require long periods of uninterrupted concentration.


* **Testers**

 People involved in ensuring the web project meets all stated goals, from design, usability, performance, accessibility, device/browser compatibility, SEO etc. Another role that is often under emphasised, testing a web project involves more than just clicking or tapping around on a screen until something breaks. Testers must have a deep understanding of the project goals, the user capabilities and expectations, and also the technology used. There are a plethora of tools available to automate testing and to extract more detailed information about potential issues. Testers must be able to constantly communicate clearly and consistently to the entire production team regarding any potential issues, providing as much or as little information as each person requires. This in itself is a skillset of its own.

## What this Book Is
This book is simply a guide or overview. While it may be opinionated in parts, it describes a realistic and achievable ideal. It's about changing the way we work together and the decisions we make in order to improve the chances of success. By understanding fully the requirements for success and the work involved, chances of success increase. You may not agree with all the advice or maybe the goals may seem lofty and unachievable, but you may find small parts useful or be able to make small incremental changes to improve the way you work.

Of course, when talking about success you need to establish some goals to measure against. Those goals are up to you. The overall goal here is to make the web better for everyone and if something you do as a result of reading this book improves the quality of your work then the goal will have been achieved.

This book is not a technical manual, a bible, a source of reference, a set of explicit rules, a code resource, or a toolkit. It's just a collection of thoughts and ideas to hopefully inspire people.

It's important to remember that there are no hard and fast rules. There are many different kinds of web projects that require different disciplines to create and maintain. More importantly, people work and interact differently so everyone's processes must be flexible and adaptable.
