# Client Managers

Your role is the most important. You are the interface between the project owner (the “client”) and the production team. That means that at some stage in every project, one or the other, probably both, are going to be pissed off with you. You may even find yourself in the position of negotiating internal conflicts within your team. How well you handle all of that depends on how well you've prepared, for this role is all about being prepared. Being prepared and being organised.

Another part of your role may involve actually seeking work. In such cases you need to represent your team and promote their skills as well as your own.

## Pitching for work

This may not apply to everyone, only those who are required to actively seek work for their organisation. If that's not you, then skip to the next section.

Should you pitch for work? no. Why? Well I'll tell you.

If you've ever watched _‘Mad Men’_ you'll be familiar with the practice. It was common in the 1960s and has, bizarrely, somehow survived into the 21st century. The client tells you they want a campaign, without giving any detail or direction. The agency furiously works on multiple ideas, picking at least one to present to the clients when they're invited in for a pitch meeting. Sometimes the agency will be invited to the client's office but it's the same game. The reason this worked in the 1960s was because there were few media platforms on which to advertise - newspapers or magazines, radio, and later TV. Today we have all those and more, but web projects aren't advertising projects so we can drop the analogy here.

The practice is still basically the same though - a company might put out an RFP - Request for Pitch - which tells you they want “a website” or “an app” and maybe goes into some minor details about what kind of website or app they're looking for. With that little information, agencies scramble to create high-fidelity mockups using placeholder content. Basically anything with the company's colours and logo on it that looks smart enough to impress the easily impressed. They'll turn up for the pitch meeting with the mockups and their fingers crossed. “Do you like that?”, “How about this?”.

This is an utter waste of time that cheapens the web agency and harms the industry as a whole. Web projects are complex and need detailed analysis of requirements followed by planning and a well-thought out design process. Even if the client company acknowledges that the mockup is just an example of the agency's design style, it's no way to chose an agency as it doesn't reflect at all the agency's overall capability or ability to produce what the company is expecting. The agency is essentially creating solutions without fully understanding the problem. It's like a doctor prescribing medicine before he's even looked at the patient - the patient has just Googled their symptoms. Web designers are problem solvers and consultants, their job is to understand the design issues and create a unique solution for each project. By asking them to produce pitch work, they are reduced to just mere stylists producing pretty and superficial pictures.

Part of your role is controlling revenue. You're bringing in the work, you're delivering it, and you're charging for it. You're giving work to your team. By agreeing to pitch work, you're giving away your team's ideas for free. It can of course be temping if the company is famous and would be a shining addition to your organisation's portfolio. Tempting too if they're posing an interesting design problem. Your team may even be eager to do the pitch work in order to get the opportunity to work on such a project. But by doing the work before you've been commissioned you've devalued your entire team. You make the work less valuable to the client and they become accustomed to ideas being cheap. How do you think that's going to work out when it comes to quoting and invoicing them?

Sometimes a client will offer companies a small fixed fee for a pitch. This may reduce the risk but often these fees do not cover costs nor resolve the main issue - the pitch work does not solve the client's problem. Another problem is introduced here, that the client may feel even more entitled to use your pitch work given that they've paid you a nominal amount for it, regardless of whether your agency is awarded the contract.

In addition to the expense of providing free work, pitching has the added cost of practice. Producing work for a pitch is not the same as for a real-world project and so the chances are your agency won't be awarded the work every time. Preparing for each pitch requires planning, brainstorming, documenting, and designing. Then there are the additional costs of transport to and from meetings, maybe even meals, expenses, accommodation etc. You may find you've alread spent a large portion of the potential income from the project before you've even started it. This is negative wealth and affects not just your agency but the industry as a whole and even your country's economy. The more you pitch and the more practice you get, the greater your success rate may be, but not necessarily.

Then there's the competition. Often the client company may already have a bias towards another agency and are just organising a pitch to show industry peers that they have selected the best agency out of a number of suitors. Maybe they've already worked with a rival agency before, or maybe the client company's representative has a personal relationship with someone in another agency but they don't want to appear to be playing favourites. It's not always a fair fight. Furthermore, rival agencies, through personal connections or investigation or by other means, may know more than what was shared in the brief, putting them at an unfair advantage. Maybe someone on the client side already has in mind the exact technology they want to use but haven't mentioned it in the brief. You could potentially lose the project purely on the basis of not including a certain word or two in your proposal.

The final problem with pitching is that the presentations, just like in _‘Mad Men’_ are theatrical performances. During your presentation you become desperate to please, and unwilling to admit to the client if something they've requested is unreasonable within their budget or inappropriate in terms of their stated goals for whatever reason. You're the expert, remember, and you're hoping that together with them you have a mutual, collaborative relationship, not one of audience and puppet-master. The nature of the relationship you have with your clients needs to be established right from the outset. You don't want to have to withhold creative ideas until some fixed-date performance, at which point the client will either upturn or downturn their mighty thumb of approval, all your team's work potentially in vain as you have no recourse to explain and justify design decisions.

Rather than pitching free work, pitch your team. You know what they can do with what budget, both in terms of time and money. If a budget isn't provided on the pitch brief, how can you propose a solution that your team can produce? You're either condemned to overshoot your quote and risk scaring away the client, or undershoot and risk working your team to the ground. Showcase what you can do and what you can offer people. No matter how you find potential projects, you have to find a balance between the effort you and your team put in and the commitment the clients are willing to make.

If you or your organisation have previously sought work through pitching, now is the time to stop. All at once, stop. Immediately. You may lose some opportunities at first but the work that you are awarded will end up being better quality and more rewarding for your entire team. That work itself can serve in your favour when seeking further opportunities. By telling clients and companies that you do not pitch, it shows you are confident and, most importantly, gives you the opportunity to educate them about why - that your goal is to use your team's expertise to solve their problems and establish a good working relationship rather than blindly kow-tow to their every whim. This sends a powerful message. Hopefully you'll be able to convince clients to skip pitches and just go with you directly, promising a more fruitful relationship. You can demonstrate to them your team's rich portfolio and creative capabilities that could be applied to their projects. Refusing pitch work also brings the issue of money into the conversation a lot earlier, which increases clarity for both parties.

Even if you do need to rely on occasional pitches - maybe you like the pressure? - you absolutely need to avoid mini-pitches throughout the project lifecycle. The “big reveal” when you've produced a new page or feature or site always fails because the work comes as a surprise. The clients were kept out of the loop and so when presented with the work they will inevitably feel the need to imprint their ownership by making arbitrary comments or design decisions of their own. Presenting work to clients should be about reviewing progress to ensure goals are being met. It should happen regularly at small incremental progress intervals to reduce risk of going in the wrong direction or having to undo or repeat too much work. Clients will surely appreciate having a clearer overview of progress and know that their feedback will be taken into consideration or even rejected if that's what the people they're paying advise, as long as their goals are being met. We can, in the end, learn something from _‘Mad Men’_, as Don Draper said: “if you don't like what's being said, change the conversation”.

## Finding the Work

If you're also serving the role of director and are running the whole team, then this is also covered in _Chapter 4 - Production Directors_. Directors are the ultimate decision makers who decide on the direction the organisation is taking and therefore what kind of projects you take on. They have put a team together and marketed the team's services with certain kinds of projects in mind. You are the filter; you see the projects coming through from existing clients and are perhaps the one seeking out new opportunities from potential clients. That means your role overlaps; you and your director share the responnsibility for knowing your team's capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses, and getting them the work that they're going to be best at and enjoy the most. That's the work that will help grow your team and reflect well on your organisation.

Depending on your organisation's financial situation, or pressure from your boss, you may be tempted to take on any work that pays. That's the easy route, right? The money comes in, everyone gets paid, and everyone's happy? On the downside, the team resents you, people are unmotivated and do poor work, perhaps people leave and your team falls apart, only adding to your stress and pressure from above as you struggle to please your existing clients while simultaneously drawing in new work that your team may need to produce with a reduced skillset and dampened motivation. They key is, as always in your role, communication. For every potential project on your horizon, consult everybody. Gauge how nervous their reactions are or how excited. Give them as much information as you know, throw around ideas, get them to talk about it, and tease out of them how they might approach such a project. Can they do it, and do they want to do it?

Ultimately though, finding work is hard. You need to cast the net wide, show off your team, your past work, get networking, and send lots of emails out. A great way is to rely on existing clients, if you have any. Get to know their business and areas that might benefit from something your organisation could offer, be it new products or new technologies that could be applied. Maybe you have access to their metrics and could recommend a way to optimise their existing website or app to increase their conversion rate. Maybe they have new budget available since you last spoke and can now upgrade the previous projects that you worked on. A friendly and well-researched email may really pay off.

If for whatever reason you can't rely on previous clients for reliable ongoing work, then you'll probably need to cold-call or email your potential clients. This really isn't all that different from reaching out to your existing or previous clients - you still need to be friendly and well-researched. Everyone is busy and nobody is going to give much time to a template email. If they already know they need a website or app then they're probably going to find an agency via a search engine and pitch their projects themselves. If they don't know that they need one then you're going to need to convince them. You're going to need to find out what their business is missing or how such a project could benefit them specifically. Furthermore, they need to know why you're the team to build it. Even if they don't follow up on your offer, if your email makes an impact then you will more likely find yourself on their contact list and may very well be the one they call if they change their mind. They may also be more confident to recommend you to others. Of course, to find businesses or organisations that may potentially be in need of a website or app is made more difficult by the fact that the best way to find them is... online... via their websites. In this case, what's wrong with their website? What's it not doing right? What can your team do better? What does the website tell you - perhaps there are dates or clues in the source code that indicate that the website hasn't been updated in years? This is your opportunity to show off your understanding to the potential client and what benefits your team could bring. You are the expert consultant who can improve their return on investment.

Finally, a great way to secure a steady stream of incoming work is to find a niche. No matter who you're building a website or app for, the underlying techniques are basically the same. However if you can generate a portfolio of work for a particular business sector - for example, higher education, food and drink, travel, etc. - then not only will you be able to market yourselves more easily to other business in that industry, but you'll also become the go to agency for such businesses so they will be more likely to seek you out, which will save you time and effort.

## Kicking off

So you've got a client and you've got a project, so it's time to kick things off. The first step is to really get to know your client. Your first few conversations with them should be about establishing their personality and management style as much as gathering requirements. You don't have to be friends or take eachother out for cocktails, but you need to be sure that you'll be able to work smoothly together. Every personality requires a different approach and given that a large part of your role is customer service, you need to be able to tailor your service to each customer.

Sometimes you can tell right from the start if a project is going to turn out to be a nightmare - if the client is just spending a budget and doesn't care about the project, if they are rude, abrupt, or arrogant, if they are already making their own demands on specific design trends or technology choices, if they don't listen to your advice, or if they are already micromanaging the project, asking for direct access to your busy and undistractable designers and developers. It's not too late to back out.

Of course, most clients aren't like that at all. However your relationship with them does depend a lot on your own behaviour during those initial conversations. You have to set the tone. You are the expert. They are paying your organistion for your organisation's expertise. They need to be confident that you know what you're talking about, that you're worth the money they're paying, and that you're being honest. If they are not confident in your expert advice then the project will inevitably run into potential disasters such as the client demanding changes based on their own arbitrary design decisions or design by committee. Your team will end up working on a project that's going in a direction that they dislike and disagree with, killing their motivation and causing tension between you and them that may also put other projects at risk.

### Be an expert

In order for the client to be confident in your _expert_ advice, your advice does indeed need to be _expert_.

That means even though you may not be undertaking any design or development work personally, you need to have a thorough grip on what your designers and developers are doing. You should continuously research new technologies, tools, and techniques. This can be done either online via RSS, newsletters, blocks, and agregator sites etc. or by simply consulting the experts in your team on a regular basis. If your organisation runs training sessions then you should attend them too. Gauge what's exciting and what has potential applications that you can market to your clients. If you find yourself speaking with the client about something that you're not quite up to speed on, then it's fine to admit that you don't know, but you must reassure them that you can find out, you can consult your team, and that you will get straight back to them. It's important that you don't hesitate, make something up, or lie to them. More often than not they will notice and they will lose confidence in your expertise.

Part of showing confidence, is how you present your ideas. Present only your best idea. Not all of your ideas. Not a selection of your ideas. Your _best_ idea. This means your team doesn't need to be fragmented with different people trying to pump out different ideas, or overworked trying to meet an arbitrary idea quota. It forces them to pool their skills and share ideas to ultimately form the best possible solution. When you show the client your best idea, be prepared to back it up with explanations about all decisions made and how the idea came about. That's what they're paying you for. If you present more than one idea, they are forced to make the expert decisions about which might be better. In the worst case they may find this irritating, in the best case they have lost confidence in your team's ability to fully address their needs.

Before presenting any ideas to clients, be sure to consult your team. Share with them your full understanding of the problem and rely on their expertise. Even though you may have researched the relevant technologies yourself, it may not be you that will eventually be building the project and so you need to be sure that what you're promising the client is definitely something that your team can deliver, else everyone will be disappointed in the end. You'll also want to make sure that any solution you offer is one achieved through a consensus decision among your production team, not just your own, lest you sour your relationship with your team.

On occasion, you may find your clients disagreeing with your proposals. In this case, you need to be able to confidently explain the decisions and back them up with data or evidence as much as possible. This may be in the form of website analytics, public surveys, user statistics, or even well-resepected blogs and articles from industry experts. You need to make them listen to you and be sure that their disagreement doesn't stem from some arbitrary personal preference. Don't forget - this book is about making the web a better place so you've got the users to think about too. You don't want to end up building something that performs poorly from a usability perspective just because your client's spouse likes it. Similarly though, you need to listen to them. You are the expert in the web and the production of web projects but _they_ are the expert in _their_ business. They know their users/customers better than you and there's a good chance their advice may be worth taking back to your team for discussion.

### Contracts & Agreements

The very first step in any project is setting down in writing exactly what your scope of work is and what are the roles and responsibilities of each party. Without a detailed agreement, you have nothing to fall back on if something goes wrong. It holds you, your team, and your client all accountable for the project's success. It also goes back to building client confidence in you and your team. Not only does it look professional, but you drawing up a formal agreement lets the client know that you have fully understood their requirements. Such an agreement may be known as a Scope of Work (SoW), an example of which may be found in _Appendix C - Scope of Work_, and should at its most basic level cover the following topics:

* Project Goals
* Feature requirements
* Roles & Responsibilities
* Timelines
* Change Request Policy
* Cost
* Success Measures

#### Schedules & Deadlines

Contract is structured to request frequent deliverables and not multi-month milestones

feedback from client

#### Change Requests

You may spend weeks or months painstakingly working on a website, covering every feature request in detail, ensuring it's the best work your team can produce. You may be very proud of the work and eager to show the client. You excitedly send them an email and wait for the praise to pour in...

“Everything is great! but...”

and then more:

“maybe we could just change this one thing...”

“also I think this could do with a bit more work...”

etc. etc.

Any requested feature not clearly listed in the original scope is beyond that scope and therefore counts as a revision or change request. This must be made explicitly clear to clients. Extending the scope, also known as “scope creep” jeopardises all other features by disrupting work schedules and putting deadlines at risk. Luckily, in your written agreement with the project owner, you have established a policy for handling these change requests... right?

There are various solutions. You may want to state a specific number of permitted revisions within the project budget and timeline, although in doing so you are essentially banking on the requests being very simple. What if it's actually a significant amount of work? You can't always accurately assess feature complexity before work on it has begun and surely the client isn't going to be aware of how much work is involved in each request. Another approach is to charge a special fee or increased rate per change request. This is more reliable and may even serve to discourage the project owner from making such requests, which can only work in your favour. You may also factor several "rounds" of change requests into your agreement, allowing a fixed amount of time and budget for dealing with changes and new features. Whatever your own solution is, you should structure your agreement and your budgets to support delivery.

#### Budgets

Don't shy away from bringing up money right at the start. Everyone knows that money is going to need to change hands so there's no point beating around the bush. Budgeting is hard. You essentially have to guess how long the project or feature set is going to take, or guess the value of the work to the client, in order to calculate how much to charge.


Budget includes research, discovery, and prototyping activities



Contract is structured to hold vendors accountable to deliverables
Contract allows the government delivery team the flexibility to adjust feature prioritization as the project evolves
Contract ensures open source solutions are evaluated alongside commercial solutions when technology choices are made
Contract specifies that software and data generated by third parties remains under our control, and can be reused and released to the public as appropriate and in accordance with the law
Contract allows us to use tools, services, and hosting from vendors with a variety of pricing models, including fixed fees and variable service-based models like “pay-for-what-you-use” services
Contract specifies a warranty period where defects uncovered by the public are addressed by the vendor(s) at no additional cost to the government
Contract includes a transition of services period and transition-out plan
key questions
How frequent are the delivery milestones?
What are the performance metrics defined in the contract? (i.e., response time, system uptime, time period to address priority issues, etc.)






- budgets

Client education means new deliverables, which have to be prepared by those directly involved in the project. Developers, designers, project managers, and other team members are responsible for creating the PDFs, training workshops, interactive guides, and other educational material.

That means more organizing, writing, designing, planning, and coding—all things we normally bill for, but now we have to bill in the name of client education.

Take this into account at the beginning of a project. The amount of education a client needs can be a consideration for taking a job at all, but it should at least factor into pricing. Hours spent helping your client use your product is billable time that you shouldn’t give away for free.

At Brolik, we’ve helped a range of clients—from those who have “just accepted that the Web isn’t a fad” (that’s an actual quote from 2013), to businesses that have a team of in-house developers. We consider this information and price accordingly, because it directly affects the success of the entire product and partnership. If they need a lot of education but they’re not willing to pay for it, it may be smart to pass on the job.

Most clients actually understand this. Those who are interested in improving their business are interested in improving themselves as well. This is the foundation for a truly fulfilling and mutually beneficial client relationship. Seek out these relationships.

It’s sometimes challenging to justify a “client education” line item in your proposals, however. If you can’t, try to at least work some wiggle room into your price. More specifically, try adding a 10 percent contingency for “Support and Training” or “Onboarding.”

If you can’t justify a price increase at all, but you still want the job, consider factoring in a few client education hours and their opportunity cost as part of your company’s overall marketing budget. Teaching your client to use your product is your responsibility as a digital business.

This never ends (hopefully)
What’s better than arming your clients with knowledge and tools, pumping them up, and then sending them out into the world to succeed? Venturing out with them!

At Brolik, we’ve started signing clients onto digital strategy retainers once their websites are completed. Digital strategy is an overarching term that covers anything and everything to grow a business online. Specifically for us, it includes audience research, content creation, SEO, search and display advertising, website maintenance, social media, and all kinds of analysis and reporting.

This allows us to continue to educate (and learn) on an ongoing basis. It keeps things interesting—and as a bonus, we usually upsell more work.

- outline roles and expectations
- communication plan
- be enthusiastic

## Gathering requirements
- talk to the right people
- know the team, consult them
- tease information out of the client
- required content/materials

Making sure you really understand what your client wants right from the start can help you avoid revision requests altogether.

“The goal is getting inside the client’s head at the beginning of the project. Then you will have fewer problems later in the process,” Jason Fowler, the owner of Wisely Woven Creative Media, says.

Take the time to thoroughly discuss not only the client’s vision for the look of the site, but also the functionality that the client needs. This will hopefully eliminate any surprises for you or the client.

Chris Lowrance, who runs Lowrance Creative, gives this example: “You agreed to a five-page site, and by the end, you’ve discovered that one of those ‘pages’ is a blog with its own main, single post (with comments), search, and category archive sub-pages.”

Having the right conversations before you begin can help you avoid these types of surprises and unnecessary revisions.

If you and a client are not a good fit, you may find yourself faced with multiple revision requests to the point where it is no longer worth your time. It is important to recognize when to walk away from a project.

“In general, you’ll know it,” Lowrance says. “When you feel like the client isn’t negotiating in good faith, but is just trying to push you for more work for the same money. When they’re insisting on things that are clearly beyond what you agreed on or can do. When they hated your initial mockups and hated the results of their own revision requests, so it’s clear you’re just not the designer for them. Yeah, there are times to walk away, and don’t be afraid to do so when you feel you need to. Just be polite and professional, no matter if the client gets rude or insulting.”

Though you may never want to have this conversation, you may have to at some point.

“Stay in web design long enough and you will reach a point where you need to ‘fire a client,’” Gentry says. “Where this point is depends on where you are in your career, what relationship you have with your clients, (unfortunately) how much other work you have available, and you personal preference. In general, you need to walk away from a project when moving forward with it is more trouble than it is worth.”

Every designer will define this point differently, but Gentry says that it may include a client who repeatedly breaks the terms of your contract, who makes excessive demands or who is constantly making changes.

At the end of the day, how you handle revisions is all about the relationship you have with your client. The designers Treehouse spoke with noted that they are willing to go above and beyond for clients who show respect for the work and the time involved.

“Web design is not just knowing code or trends or techniques,” Fowler said. “It is also knowing how to manage the project and give great customer service. The issue of revisions is an issue of client management and people skills.”

What our clients do with their websites is just as important as the websites themselves. We may pride ourselves on building a great product, but it’s ultimately up to the client to see it succeed or fail. Even the best website can become neglected, underused, or messy without a little education and training.

Too often, my company used to create amazing tools for clients and then send them out into the world without enough guidance. We’d watch our sites slowly become stale, and we’d see our strategic content overwritten with fluffy filler.

It was no one’s fault but our own.

As passionate and knowledgeable web enthusiasts, it’s literally our job to help our clients succeed in any way we can, even after launch. Every project is an opportunity to educate clients and build a mutually beneficial learning experience.

Meeting in the middle
If we want our clients to use our products to their full potential, we have to meet them in the middle. We have to balance our technical expertise with their existing processes and skills.

From that experience, we learned not only to create online tools that complement our clients’ existing business processes, but also that we can be instrumental in helping clients embrace new processes. We now see it as part of our job to educate our clients and explain the technical and strategic thought behind all of our decisions.

## Working collaboratively
- pre-empt common issues
- get to know your client
- get to know your team

## Clear & constant communication
- be honest

Even with a contract, it is inevitable one of your clients is going to ask for revisions that were not within the bounds of your original agreement. You can be flexible about these changes, but you don’t have to make them for free.

“I used to just go along with it,” Bryan Gentry, who runs Bryan Gentry Web Design, says of the additional revision requests. “But now I explain to my customer if their requests go beyond the scope of what they are paying me to do. Really, this is what hourly rates are for. If the customer asks for more revisions, you can let them know that you are happy to make the change and add it to the bill.”

Walking a client through the changes can help them understand why you need to charge what you do.

“Generally, I make every effort to provide them with the solution they are looking for, but there are times when I will tell a client, ‘That can’t be done well,’ and I’ll explain why, or I’ll say, ‘Yes, that can be done, but it’s going to push the completion of the project way back,’” Fowler says.

Lowrance adds, “’Yes, and…’ is a powerful tool both for conflict management and contract negotiation. Let’s say toward the end of the project, the client asks for something nuts. You can say, ‘No, that’s not possible because…,’ but it’s even better to say, ‘Yes, we could do that, and it’ll cost you this much extra because….’ This way, you either extend the project and get paid more, or you’ve made it clear to the client that their request is unfeasible but in a positive way.”

You should charge your regular hourly rate for any revisions outside the scope or your original quote.

- documentation
- maintain enthusiasm

## Delivery
- structuring budgets and contracts
- gathering feedback

http://boagworld.com/season/10/episode/1004/

Feedback will tell you whether what you did made sense or works well, but not what to do or what the vision should be. Vision can't be crowdsourced. Having a project with a bunch of patches and hacks for every complaint usually ends up being hard to iterate on and maintain.

Strong feedback = engaged enough to become emotionally invested.

- support

Education and support can, and usually does, take the form of setting an example. Some clients may not fully understand the benefits of a content strategy, for instance, so you have to show them results. Create relevant and well-written sample blog posts for them, and show how they can drive website traffic. Share articles and case studies that relate to the new tools you’re building for them. Show them that you’re excited, because excitement is contagious. If you’re lucky and smart enough to follow Geoff Dimasi’s advice and work with clients who align with your values, this process will be automatic, because you’ll already be invested in their success.

We should be teaching our clients to use their website, app, content management system, or social media correctly and wisely. The more adept they are at putting our products to use, the better our products perform.

We’ve found that by fostering collaboration post-launch, we not only help our clients use our product more effectively and grow their business, but we also alleviate a lot of the panic that kicks in right before a site goes live. They know we’ll still be there to fix, tweak, analyze, and even experiment.

This ongoing digital strategy concept was so natural for our business that it’s surprising it took us so long to implement it. After 10 years making websites, we’ve only offered digital strategy for the last two, and it’s already driving 50 percent of our revenue.

It pays to be along for the ride
The extra effort required for client education is worth it. By giving our clients the tools, knowledge, and passion they need to be successful with what we’ve built for them, we help them improve their business.





The answer to making more money is not always getting more clients or charging more.

You can have dozens of requests from prospective clients, charge more, but make no money.

I’m talking about the clients who passed on hiring you and went with a competitor, weren’t interested or you couldn’t close the deal with. These are all missed opportunities.

For these situations, just “getting more clients” or “charging more”, isn’t the solution. Instead, you have to optimize your business to yield better results.

In this post, I’ll cover ways you can effectively optimize your business to close more projects and make more money.

The first thing you’re going to do is…

Stop Calling Yourself A “Freelancer”
I’ll admit it…I used to call myself a freelancer. However, I learned this was a mistake and quickly corrected it. To make more money, you have to stop calling yourself a freelancer and instead call yourself a consultant, strategist, professional, or something else that fits your expertise.

Whenever I hear the word “freelancer”, I think of a 17-year-old boy on summer vacation who’s looking to make extra money on the side. Or someone who’s doing it as a hobby, while backpacking around Europe. Do you want to be perceived as someone who is just doing things on the side? Of course not.

When you call yourself a freelancer, you devalue your skills and expertise. The client sees you as someone who is cheaper, less serious and potentially unreliable (will he/she be around in a few months?). These aren’t the types of people that serious and high paying clients want to trust with their business.

From now on, whenever you’re speaking to or working with a prospective client, avoid using the word freelancer. Avoid saying, “My name is John, and I’m a freelance designer.” Or, “My name is Janet and I’m a freelance writer.” Instead, you’re a design consultant, a strategic writer or marketing professional.

Your task is to pick a new word that will make you look more professional in the eyes of current and prospective clients. This won’t create a magical difference overnight, but will help you over time as you try to land larger and higher paying clients.

Create winning estimates
There was a point in time when I would send my project estimate to a client as a plain number, after a lengthy email conversation. My last reply to the email thread would be something like “OK, I can do all of this for $X.”

Sending a price through email is unprofessional, unorganized and the value you’re hoping to bring the client is lost between dozens of email exchanges.

For any project, no matter how big or small, always create an estimate (or proposal). When I started creating estimates and sending them to my clients as .PDF documents or a link to view on the web, I immediately began to win more business.

I use Ballpark, which allows me to create beautiful estimates with templates and my branding. For most of the web work my company does, estimates usually cover the following:

Phases of the project and deliverables
Pricing for each phase
A link to a scope of work document that is pre-approved by the client. The price covers the work, requirements and expectations agreed upon in the scope. Anything outside this scope is extra and to be billed later.
Rough timeline
Fine print including out of scope charges and what’s not included
Deposit/payment terms to get started
Estimate expiration date (this estimate will expire if it is not signed within 15 days of being issued)
The estimate structure above works well because:

Clients are usually shopping around with a few vendors at a time. The estimate helps the client understand what your process looks like and exactly what they’re paying for/getting against others.
You take most of the guesswork out by providing what you’ll do for each phase, the pricing, a timeline, the outcome and other project details.
It makes you look professional and builds up trust with the client.
There are probably more benefits to writing up a good estimate, but I’ve found those 3 to be key when pitching prospective clients.

I also combine each estimate with a short letter reiterating why they should hire us, how we’ll achieve their goals and how the price is an investment that will yield them a return (the return being whatever the goal of the project is).

If you aren’t doing so, I would highly recommend creating a written estimate or proposal for your next project. If you want to close larger projects and charge more, you need to come off as professional and make it easy for the client to understand what they’re paying for.

There are plenty of others apps to create estimates/proposals like Harvest and Bidsketch (more here too), so find one that works for you and start using it right away.

Don’t charge hourly
Charging hourly limits your revenue potential and comes with a myriad of other problems:

Hourly rates have a ceiling; you can only charge so much per hour until a client pushes back
There are only so many billable hours in a year, which caps your revenue
An hourly rate is easy to negotiate/compare (“your rate is $100/hr? I can pay someone for $20/hr on oDesk for the same thing”).
You’re selling yourself short if you work fast
You’re selling time, rather than results or an outcome, which is what really matters to clients
Billing by the hour limits your growth potential and puts unnecessary focus on hours worked, rather than client’s business and outcome.

Instead, try billing your next project with one of the methods mentioned below. These methods will allow you to charge more because they focus on the outcome or deliverable of the project, rather than hours spent.

It’s also important to find out from each client what the goal of the project is. It could be making more money, increasing signups, or even getting more downloads. You should focus your efforts on how you plan to achieve that goal, which will make it easier to justify your pricing.

Charging per project
When you charge per project, you provide the client with a fixed price to do all of the work. Normally, you’ll need to have an in-depth discussion with the client to understand the full project scope, requirements and their expectations.

Charging per project is one of my favorite ways to bill, because the client knows the total investment up-front. With hourly, the client usually hears something like, “I charge $120 an hour and it will take anywhere from 80-100 hours.”

That can worry a lot of clients and they’ll stress over every single hour. They’ll also compare your hourly rate to their own or others in your field and try to lowball you. This is not the type of back and forth game you want to play.

Instead, charging per project makes it easier to bill a higher rate because there is no indication of an hourly breakdown or rate in the estimate. Plus, if you focus on the result or ROI you’re going to bring the client, they won’t look at the quote as an expense, but rather a valuable investment.

Charging weekly
When you charge weekly, a client pays you a flat rate to work on their stuff for the week. The focus again should be on the deliverable or outcome, and not how many hours it takes to get there.

Patrick McKenzie wrote a great article on weekly billing and it goes in-depth on why you should consider charging weekly and how to begin doing so (he explains it better than I can here).

Charging monthly
Charging by the month is as simple as billing a flat, month to month rate for the client to hire you.

I know a design consultant who charges $15,000 a month to work on client projects. The client gets a minimum number of hours per month (but normally this isn’t the focus) and the consultant dedicates time to the client’s business. This makes scheduling easy and provides predictable cash flow.

Charging monthly can also work great for retainers, where clients will need some type of maintenance, upkeep, 1-on-1 consulting, additional work, etc.

Pick one
These are some common alternatives to billing by the hour on projects and I highly recommend you try one of these methods on your next project (if you haven’t already).

You can raise your rate and make more money, because the client won’t be looking at a column of hours and an hourly rate anymore (and trying to lower it). Instead, the focus turns to something along the lines of “this is the total cost for your project to achieve the result or goal that your business needs.”

Charge for project management
You should be charging for project management on every single project. All of those emails, phone calls, skype chats, Basecamp discussions and general communication with your client should come at an additional cost.

I add a 10% or 15% project management fee to the total of an estimate, which covers project management for the entire duration of the project.

I use a 10% fee when there is less than 2 stakeholders and the project scope is straightforward. For projects where I have to work with more than 2 stakeholders and/or the project is complex, I use a 15% fee, since those types of projects generally have longer “management” cycles.

For example, if I’m working on a complex project and the quote comes to $25,000, I’ll add “project management” as my last line item at $3,750, which would cover all project management for the project.

I also explain this fee covers phone calls, discussions, reviews and any other communication during the project. You can add this on your next project as a simple line item like I mention above, or bake it into each phase of your estimate.

Outsource when you’re booked
I’ve always worked directly with most of my clients, but as things started to grow I had less time to work on every project that came my way.

Outsourcing is the best way to take on more projects than you can work on personally. To do this, you need to network and find people in your industry that have similar skills and experience as you. When new projects come, you can delegate them, handle the project management and make a good profit.

Of course, this only works if you hire people with comparable skills as you. For every project that you outsource, you should have the same results and quality as if you were working on it, so there is no inconsistency in your business.

I also never mention the word “outsource” to a client. The word outsource makes it seem like you are taking their project and sending it somewhere very cheap without much oversight.

Instead, I always explain to clients that I have a small, remote team that works with me on projects, which are contractors I’ve built a close business relationship with. This has worked out great and I’ve never had a problem using this approach.

I always guarantee the same quality and manage the entire project, which makes the client comfortable and they’re usually more focused on the outcome, rather than who is doing the day-to-day work.

I’ve met plenty of freelancers who turn down projects because they’re booked, which is OK, but really they should outsource these projects to bring in additional revenue. Not everyone wants to outsource or “scale”, which is fine.

However, if you do want to take on more projects to make more money/scale then you should:

Stop calling yourself a freelancer (as mentioned earlier).
Position and brand yourself as a studio, collective or small agency (not just a one person shop).
Register as an actual business, rather than working under your name (explained later).
I found doing these three things makes it easier to outsource because you look like a “real” company to the client, rather than a solo freelancer shipping work out.

Communicate quickly
Prospective clients almost always thank me for how fast I reply to their emails. I reply within minutes (normally less than 5) and this catches their attention because it shows I’m serious, reliable and sets a positive tone moving into the exploratory phase of their project.

Fast communication has helped my company make more money and is even a reason why clients choose us.

Think about it from a client’s perspective: if you’re going to pay someone thousands for a project, are you going to hire the consultant that takes 4 days to reply to an initial email or is a pain to get on the phone? Or the consultant who answers in 5 minutes, can hop on a call right away, and is ready to send an estimate by the end of the week?

The answer is clear and there should be no excuse for slow communication (especially if you work online!). This is something you can fix right away; just simply start answering your email faster, rather than ignoring messages for later. You’ll be amazed at how some clients react to fast email replies and it will lead to a higher project closing ratio, I guarantee it.

For those of you that are often busy or out of office, send a quick, one sentence reply that you’re tied up at the moment and will reply later. This type of gesture goes a long way and shows prospective clients how important they are to you (and again builds trust).

Iron out the details
Sometimes I receive new project inquiries where the scope is loosely defined or all over the place. This can make it hard to estimate the cost, timeline and even client expectations for the project. For these types of projects, I’ll normally do a bit more hand-holding after I’ve qualified the client.

I gather as much information from the client as possible for their project and then ask questions to find out what they really need and their goals. Normally, this is over back and forth email conversations, where things can get unorganized and sloppy.

When this is the case, I’ll take what I know and distill it into a scope document with Google Docs. I send that document to the client and they can comment or make notes back. Usually, this is a perfect way to organize and flesh out a project with a client who doesn’t have a concrete idea of what they want or a huge budget.

This process does require a bit of up-front work, but I’ve found when you put this much detail and effort into the client’s project (if they haven’t), they’ll likely hire you.

Plus, this is the best possible way to minimize risk when budgeting projects because the scope, requirements, deliverables and expectations are written out and agreed upon.

The next time you get a project that is unclear, create a roadmap or scope (or improve the current one), and the client will likely hire you because of the care and time you’ve invested.

Get a deposit
You should always require a deposit before beginning any work with a client. A deposit shows that a client is willing and able to pay, and tells them that you won’t work without being paid.

I normally require a 50% deposit for small projects and 20% (or per milestone) for larger projects. Deposits are non-refundable for work completed. I note this as early as possible to clients (in my estimates), so they know up-front what the billing schedule and expectations are.

If a client is reluctant to pay a deposit, then you shouldn’t work with them, plain and simple. Chances are they aren’t serious and probably won’t pay later anyway.

I know plenty of freelancers who have been burned on projects because they didn’t get money up-front, so don’t let this happen to you and start requiring a deposit upon contract signing.

Be a real business
If you want to make more money, you should register as a real business. This is especially true if you want to outsource work, scale and land higher paying clients.

There are a few reasons to register as a business wherever you live:

Ownership of your company name
Shows clients you are serious and legitimate
Makes it easier to scale and outsource work
Attract and work with established businesses (no longer coming off as a single person)
You can build a real company brand, rather than working under your personal name
Tax benefits and liability protection (depending on your country)
Business banking (no longer doing everything from your personal account)
A lot of “freelancers” avoid registering as a business because it takes time and the process can be overwhelming.

However, if you’re serious about growing your business and making more money, then you should act and looks serious by becoming a real business.

Closing thoughts
These optimization tactics have worked really well to help my business grow and make more money. 2015 is right around the corner and a lot of you are looking to make a splash in the new year. If you haven’t already done so, consider implementing these now or for 2015 to level up your freelance consulting business.

I’ve only listed a few strategies here and want to hear from you. What strategies and optimization tactics do you use to make more money and grow your business?

Post in the comments and I’ll reply back.
