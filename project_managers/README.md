# Project Managers

_Reading time ~ 45 minutes_

Your role is the most important. Not everyone can handle this role, but given that it touches on every part of the project, it's something that every web professional should try at some point and indeed many have, with Project Managers usually having previously been designers and developers. You are responsible for making sure the rest of the production team can do their jobs smoothly, for making sure the project actually gets produced, and produced to the best of your team's abilities. You are the enabler. 

Most people fall into web project management having previously worked in other roles, most commonly design or development. In some organisations roles are interchanged or rotated so that everyone gets a chance to be a project manager, thus giving everyone a greater commercial and logistical insight into the realities of running web projects, even businesses themselves. I like this idea. Some people will be weaker than others but they can garner support from everybody's shared experience. At the same time, being a project manager, even if only temporarily, adds value from new skills and knowledge, and generates confidence.

Project management is a careful balance of priorities weighted more towards clients, budgets, and schedules, but also concerned with product content, aesthetics, technologies, and performance. Rather than having a small number of things to work on at any one time, there are seemingly countless issues to deal with and numerous key decisions to make on a daily, even hourly, basis.

You're stuck there in the middle of everything, with demands made on you by the client or client manager, your boss, as well as the rest of the production team. They all want different things from you at all times and you have to try and keep them all happy. Of course, you are also making constant demands from all of them, the only difference being that they're probably less understanding as dealing with interruptions isn't as much a part of their job as it is yours. In most cases, when you can be nice and organised any and all interruptions can be scheduled to reduce their impact, but when it's inevitable it helps to share an understanding of the combined pressures of budgeting, scheduling, request handling, and project planning. Thus the rest of the team learn that you have the best overview of the project and gain confidence that your decisions and interruptions are ultimately what's best for the project's success. Afterall, you must be doing something right if you keep delivering successful projects and work keeps coming in.

Unfortunately, as a natural consequence of your large and scattered workload, you can't be expected to always provide perfectly detailed, scoped, and unambiguous briefs and specifications, perfectly accurate costs and timelines, or tease out world-class design work and code. You can't be expected to please everyone all the time. But that of course is the goal and all you can ask for is trust that you're doing your best to work towards it. It's not easy, but hopefully by following some of the advice in this chapter you can be a happier, more productive, and more successful web project manager.

## Success Criteria

In order to perform this role well you'll need experience. In order to gain experience, you'll need to peform this role. However, maybe some other experience can help get you started. More often than not, web project managers have worked previously as designers, developers, account managers, testers, or IT technicians. All web projects are eventually delivered, but whether or not every part of the project is delivered in the best state highlights the value of the web project manager. If the project manager does indeed have a background in another role, it's often the case that that area, be it design or development or whatever, receives more than its fair share of attention. A designer may produce the most stunning UX features, at the expense of blowing the budget on laborious front-end development work. This is where the experience comes in. The longer people cover this role the more accustomed they become to balancing resources while maintaining scope, bugget, timelines, and overall quality. To be truly effective, you need to be able to understand each role; you should embark on your own learning quest to ensure that you yourself can create content matrices, wireframes, UI style guides, JavaScript functions, Test scripts etc.  If you can't then you will be relying on others to make your decisions for you or, worse, representing false expertise to those to whom you're accountable. So, if you're relatively new to this role, then don't worry - it will get easier, and you'll get better, even if you're great already. The way to stay monitor and constantly work on your performance is by being aware of your success measures, or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Your success measures may not be as obvious or easy to assess as those of, for example, a designer - analytics data - or developer - bug reports, analytics data - so we'll cover some ideas here.

The main idea behind KPIs is that they must be measurable metrics. Individual projects may have, indeed should have, their own KPIs to assess the extent to which the post-launch project has achieved it's initial pre-launch goals. The metrics recorded must be specific and consistent in order to allow for objective comparison.

Examples of good project KPIs might be:

* increase conversions by 5%
* reduce time spent by customer service responding to inquiries
* increase subsciptions
* generate 10% more traffic
* improve Google search results position for X keyword

Conversely bad KPIs are vague or difficult, if not impossible, to measure:

* increase brand awareness
* improve usability
* increase time spent on the website

We'll go further into establishing per-project KPIs later.

### Why KPIs are good

At the most basic level, having specific success measures, goals that you are working towards, help to maintain focus on what's important. You may pass on the requirements, make a timeline, meet your deadline, and deliver your project. But that doesn't count as a success if your production team are tired, angry, and resentful and your project of poor quality. This is only going to make your job harder on future projects. Aside from focus, KPIs are valuable in analysing mistakes or failures, allowing you to put measures in place to avoid them in future. If you know exactly what went wrong, you can fix it. 

### Your KPIs

#### Project KPIs

We've cover this more later, but having a set of consistent KPIs for each project, such as a performance budget or analytics targets, allows you to measure and compare on a per-project basis the success of your work. Doing increasingly better at meeting or exceeding project targets shows that you're doing something right. You might want to state an explicit target for each project, e.g. _Meet 100% of project KPIs_

#### Project Goals

Each project proposal should start with some explicit business goals. To what extent these goals have been met can be more difficult to measure and may rely on client feedback. You will certainly want to gather feedback from your client, so liaise with them directly or with your client manager. This KPI is about determining the happiness of the client or project owner. The happier they are, the better you and your team have performed. A concrete example might be: _“Achieve each and every primary and secondary objective”_, or _“Achieve a client satisfaction rating of 90%”_.

#### Timelines & Deadlines

This one is quite straightforward. Did you meet your deadlines? Did everything stay on schedule? E.g.

* _“Meet every deadline”_
* _“Provide agreed deliverables at the end of each week”_
* _“Extend final deadline by no more than 3 days”_

#### Bug Reports

This may not be a reliably comparable metric as each tester will have their own reporting methods, groups of testers may report duplicate issues, and different projects will invariably have different levels of complexity. Still, you may be able to find something you can monitor. How quickly can bugs be closed? How many bugs are reported on average? What kind of bugs are reported? How effective is the reporting? Aside from providing you with useful information to optimise processes, you may be able to extrapolate some information surrounding your team's effectiveness and productivity, which it is your responsibility to optimise.

#### Team Happiness & Productivity

This is exactly the kind of bad KPI mentioned above, being unspecific and seemingly impossible to measure. A major part of your role, however, is keeping your team happy and productive so it would be a good idea to try and find a way to measure the extent of your success (or failure) in this area. Some kind of survey is probably in order, certainly project review meetings, or “post mortems”.

Your ultimate goal in this role is that you'll be able to easily look at a web project and envisage the whole solution in its entirety right rom the start. You'll be able to see clearly what will be involved, be able to easily avoid or mitigate risks, and maintain momentum, until finally seeing through to a successful delivery. You'll understand the precise creative and technical requirements almost as well as any designer or developer. You'll be able to communicate with everyone in a clear and tailored way, speaking in their language such that they are left in no doubt as to the expectations and objectives. You'll keep the team motivated and focused on producing quality work, while shielding them from stress. You'll have no problems producing product plans, schedules, sitemaps, wireframes, and functional specifications that your production team can work from with ease.

## The Right Mindset

You control chaos with a strong determined smile and a tenacious attitude that means stuff can get done. You're also squeezed in the middle of various departments and levels of seniority, being pulled in different directions, into different environments, despite everyone working towards the same goal - the project being delivered successfully. So yeah... it's stressful... but it can also reward you with the greatest sense of accomplishment as you know more than anyone how much work has gone into putting the project together. Many people fail to appreciate just how many hats you have to wear or what skill it takes to accomplish your role, yet they all look to you to be the fountain of knowledge, to give them direction, help resolve problems, and be the steady rock while everyone else crumbles.

So how are you supposed you cope? It begins with honesty, trust, and integrity. No matter what you must stay calm and give everyone the cold hard facts throughout the lifecycle of each project. This will cement your position as a leader and will earn you respect from both the client or client manager as well as the rest of the production team. An environment of mutual respect is one that is much more condusive to a productive team and a truly excellent end product. There are many points in a project when you feel you may have to withhold or sugarcoat the truth. For example, explaining why a deliverable is late, telling a team member their work isn't up to scratch, or admitting that you yourself made a mistake. This will only serve to damage your relationships in the long-run, and your role is nothing if not dependent on solid relationships. It's always obvious when people are being false or obfuscatory. Telling the truth may hurt in the short term but it will help you build stronger relationships in the longterm. Once the client gets over their anger about the late delivery, they will at least know you have the courage to tell them bad news and will be more likely to trust what you tell them going forward. This is especially valuable for long-running projects.

Similarly integrity can be displayed by admitting responsibility for a mistake that you or a team member made, openly defending a client or team member, or insisting on maintaining quality standards, despite the pressure of looming deadlines. Having the fortitude to take the flak from angry clients isn't easy, adding an unneeded and undeserved surplus to your existing stress levels, but it will earn you reputation points. If on the other hand you fail to act with honesty and integrity as a project manager then eventually those you work with will wise up and start to treat you with mistrust, which will be incredibly damaging to all your projects.

Project managers all too often get the blame. Designers and developers may think they always agree to any and all client requests, no matter how preposterous, and just filter them down to those doing the real work, by which point it's too late to say no. Unfortunately, this blame is sometimes deserved. A big part of your job, and part of being honest and having integrity is standing up to the clients or client managers and rejecting requests if they are going to be too difficult, out of scope, or jeopardise other parts of the project delivery. They are paying you to advise them, to tell them the cold hard facts, to protect them from poor decisions, even if it's not what they were hoping to hear. Situations when project managers might yield to such requests are when they don't have enough knowledge, experience, or confidence to challenge the request and suggest an alternative, or when they are simply feeling lazy. As a project manager you need to ensure you equip yourself with knowledge, experience, confidence, and motivation, exactly for situations like this. If you don't have the knowledge, admit this to your team; it's ok to not know about something as long as you're willing to learn, and maybe another team member could step in and fill your knowledge gap. If on the other hand it's a courage or confidence issue then fear not, for this is completely normal. To overcome that fear, practice your reasoning with other team members first to reinforce your decisions. Remember that part of your role is to provide expert consultation to the client while showing loyalty and dedication to your team. 

Sometimes, you will fail. There will be times when, perhaps due to circumstances beyond your control, you will have to accept bad requests and deliver them to your team. As with any other team-based role, one of the most important skills is empathy. First understand the request is going to piss people off; they are going to be resentful when they work on it. Also understand that this anger and resentment is a strong emotional reaction that means they actually care about what they do, which is a very good sign - they're not just being difficult. It's better to have a designer or developer angry about something with good cause than completely indifferent to everything, delivering as much or as little as required like a mindless automaton, incapable of innovation and passion, creating lacklustre project work. Recognise your team's frustration as passion and embrace it.

Earlier we mentioned mutual respect. When delivering work requests to your team, whether deemed good or bad, you need to offer an explanation along with it. Why we need to carry out this request, why you're assigning them, what your expectations are. No explanation and it's as if you're implying they don't care, can't understand, or that their opinions on the matter are not worth anything. Web designers and developers are highly skilled and intelligent people that will definitely understand, and want to understand, the background behind each request. If a request might at first appear a trifle waste of their time, then taking the time to explain your decision on why you've accepted the request may work to turn an atmosphere of resistance and frustration into one of acceptance and motivation. If you explain the history of the decision along with the rationale, then the same clever people you're asking to execute the request will hopefully realise that they too would make the same decision in your shoes.

Honesty, integrity, trust, empathy - the character traits of a great web project manager.

### Staying Positive

This is good general life advice. If you stay positive during a challenging time then it's more likely to yield a positive result. Conversely if you take a negative viewpoint then the chances of failure are maximised. This lesson is often misunderstood or abused in the workplace, resulting in short-term failure. Imagine a situation where a client makes a huge change request or imposes on you an unreasonable deadline, or where your production team entirely fail to deliver something promised. If you don't offer unconditional agreement, positive feedback or calm reassurance, then you may be labelled as being negative.

But maybe you are being negative. Maybe what's being asked of you and your team is actually feasible? Maybe you're dooming the challenge to failure before you've even tried? Part of your job is sometimes to provide negation, refusal, or denial, but always to avoid lacking positivity, lacking constructive criticism, or being miserable, gloomy, and unpleasant. We've all encountered negative people in this industry. There are those who are never positive about any project or strategy, and there are those who often come across as negative but are just being realistic and bravely speaking up while still pushing forward with the work. We're aiming to be the second type, of course. It's actually better to point out problems with ideas rather than always just trying to be blindly positive about everything, like some hipster valley entrpreneur who's already adopted the mentality that simply being positive means they will surely prevail. Sure, this mentality is infectious and makes for a much nicer, more motivational work environment. But being positive about everything can be dellusional - if everything is great then nothing needs to be fixed or improved. Sometimes you're just going to have to shit on people's _positive_ suggestions and requests with cold hard facts. There's not enough time, or money, or what they're asking can't be done, or it's really not a good idea because... etc. So by all means try and stay generally positive, but be prepared to be negative. How you handle your negativity situations will make or break you as a project manager though - either people will gradually resent you or come to respect your judgement. You can only learn through your mistakes so just keep making them and move forward.

### Being Nicely Negative

> A negative person is rarely positive, a realistic person is sometimes positive and sometimes not, but when not, always tries to get things into a state where they can feel positive about it as opposed to constantly ‘thinking positive’ and screwing up time and time again. Being realistic does not mean limiting your dreams; it simply means you make sensible steps to reaching them.

> -_Sam Barnes_

When it comes to disagreeing with people or expressing your concerns, never assume that they have the same level of understanding as you do. A client's request may seem so phenominally unreasonable to you that you may want to simply spontaneously combust and be done with it all. It's obviously not that unreasonable to them otherwise they wouldn't have asked, would they?

Remember that as the project manager you have the widest field of view over the entire project. You know your team and their capabilities. You know what they're working on, what they need to be productive, what their limits are. You know the project, what features it entails, when everything has to be completed by and what's needed to bring each part to completion. It comes back to empathy - you need to put yourself in their shoes and understand where their request or comment is coming from. Then you need to take some time out to think before you respond. Collect your thoughts, your knowledge, and experience, and determine whether the request is actually reasonable or the comment justified. Maybe your instincts are wrong on this one. You have the facts to hand so approach the problem calmy and logically and use them to justify your response. Take the problem, break it down into smaller chunks, and assess the time, money, and people situation to determine the path of least resistance. If you still can't find a way to make it work, after sincerely trying, then you have good reasoning to go back with. Once you have these cold hard facts then even those of the sunniest disposition won't be able to refute them.

But you're still at risk of coming across as a negative nancy. If you really disagree with something then it's not worth wasting time complaining about it unless you're willing to try and fix it or offer a reasonable solution. Part of your role is to solve problems just as much as it is the designer and developers'. Always follow up your dream-crushing facts with either a proposed solution or a forum where a solution can be derived, such as a meeting. Maybe you can find a spare resource, adopt some clever workarounds, get more money, or reframe the problem. Find a way to get positive about it again.

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls

Preparing for the worst should put you in a good position to deal with problems when they inevitably arise. Some projects seem endless, you often don't have enough resources, technical systems and tools break down, people get sick, clients or bosses try to micromanage, and sooner or later everything turns into a disaster. Web projects are confusing. The most common pitfall lies in miscommunication that serves to add to that confusion.

Never assume that you know better than the client or that you understand the pressures that they too are under. They may have superiors to report to or a team of stakeholders to juggle. Add to that they probably don't have as much experience as you with working on the web. While some of their requests may seem ridiculous to you, they are entirely serious. You have to resist the temptation to be condescending or patronising in any way but rather remain polite and helpful. Frame your replies to such a request in terms of previously agreed steps in the process, highlighting the tasks that you and your team are currently working on and how you will aim towards achieving the underlying goal behind the request. Coming back with useful and reassuring information not only satisfies the client but also provides them with something to go back to their own team with. 

Avoid using jargon. Always consider who you're speaking to and how best to communicate your message to them in their terms, without being patronising of course.

Don't submit to envy when you see others leaving work earlier than you or arriving later. There will inevitably be times when they are busier than you. You have the benefit of seeing an end to every project, you get recognition for successful deliveries, and you have clear success criteria, known targets, which perhaps others don't. It may seem like the client manager's job is to promise clients that which you have to deliver without even a clear idea if it's even possible, but in fact part of their job is to convince the client to go with your team, and at your costs, no matter what. Your plan is fixed and certain, based on specific tasks and goals, while those of others may not be. Always consider the situation others are in and try to cut them a little slack now and again. Never criticise unduly and when you do, make it constructive by offering helpful advice and trying to find a common ground. The alternative is to jeopardise relationships that you rely on and ultimately contribute to your already towering mountain of stress.

Resign yourself to the fact that there is a fixed, maybe even reduced budget. 
Also resign yourself to the fact that scope likely isn't fixed and is sooner to be expanded than reduced. Great! Unfortunately, this is just something you'll have to accept and move on. No point crying over spilt milk, as the saying goes. A truly great project manager will find a way to maximise the resources at hand to produce the optimum result, and that is the quintessential challenge of your role.

There are various tools and methods for dealing with this challenge. Primarily among them is by building a great team and cultivating relationships such that everyone helps eachother and works efficiently. Easy right? pfft. An easy way to give yourself some leeway is to always overestimate the time and money required. Overspend the budget, place deadlines beyond a date by which you know delivery is achievable. You may need to justify this on the basis that future projects for the same project owner will allow them to reclaim the overspend for the current one.

> Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge: Look, Mr. Scott, I'd love to explain everything to you, but the Captain wants this spectrographic analysis done by 1300 hours.

> Scotty: Do you mind a little advice? Starfleet captains are like children. They want everything right now and they want it their way. But the secret is to give them only what they need, not what they want.

> Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge: Yeah, well, I told the Captain I'd have this analysis done in an hour.

> Scotty: How long will it really take?

> Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge: An hour!

> Scotty: Oh, you didn't tell him how long it would *really* take, did ya?

> Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge: Well, of course I did.

> Scotty: Oh, laddie. You've got a lot to learn if you want people to think of you as a miracle worker.

Alternatively you can work to lower budgets than you actually have in order to cater in advance for the inevitable overrun. The best case is you deliver under budget and attain some internal process skills, and the worst case is that you deliver on budget. Either way, the project owner is going to be very happy and think you're a miracle worker. You may find pushback from your team, however, so you'll need to convince them of the Pareto Principle - that 80% of the project outcome is realised by only 20% of the work put in. If they can work more efficiently, making that 20% great, then maybe the rest isn't as important, so long as the client is satisfied. Much of that 80% is made up of review cycles and unplanned iterations.

However you decide to plan your project, make sure you involve your team from the start with open communication. Decide together how to share out laborious tasks, who can help who with what. You'll also need to keep your hands dirty throughout the project lifecycle. Get your hands dirty in the code, the copy, the images. Familiarise yourself with the strain of the boring and repetitive tasks. Understand the work and what you're asking of your team. Encourage everyone to divide their labour and share what they've learned. They should focus on high-concentration tasks for only an hour at a time, and review each other's work. Equip every project with tools and techniques than can be re-used along the way. Do your best to make it a team effort.

> It is a platitude that any kind of management only has two ways to get anything done – action and communication. Communication without action is simply pretending, and action without communication will never lead anywhere. Big gestures, speeches, or any other kind of ‘pep talk’ are not really well suited for motivating people’s participation without follow through.

> _- Michael Dlugosch_

It's all too easy to fall into narcism as a web project manager. We have so much to do. Our work is so important - without what we do everything else falls apart. We don't have time to keep people happy, we just need to get our work done and keep everything running as smoothly as possible both for the sake of the project... and, let's face it, our own comfort. We crave the reputation, the recognition, the status in the team. However if that's our primary concern then it will negatively impact the team's motivation for go the extra mile for us. A project manager must manage, and that means to lead, and to lead is to take action.

> Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.

> _- Master Yoda_

The most common pitfall is fear, and as Yoda said, it does indeed lead to anger and suffering. At the start of every project you know that things will go wrong. You'll struggle to meat a deadline, you'll have to deal with difficult client requests, even an unresponsive client, or your best developer may fall ill or go on holiday. Knowing this inevitability and still being unprepared for it is the web project manager's cardinal sin. You need to stay calm and anticipate how you're going to handle the situation. A good start is planning and documentation. Documenting everything, including communication, and having written contingencies in place will put everyone at ease when the time comes. An unreasonable demand doesn’t get any better, regardless of how often you repeat it. If the client or client manager is adamant about a particular request or feature that is beyond the agreed scope, then you must comprehensively document the interdependencies involved. Break the problem down into individual tasks. What is required for each task? Who will do the work? What will that require of other team members? What will the deliverables be? How long will it take? etc. This documentation will not only make implementation easier and put everyone on the same page, but will also be good to take back to the client to justify a spending increase or deadline delays.

Try and avoid any and all assumptions as much as possible. Using a particular tool or framework will not necessarily alleviate problems or reduce the time required, you can't rely on the developer to fix all reported bugs in a fixed time period before you know exactly what the bugs are. Try and identify all the likely points of failure well in advance. Most importantly, when things do go wrong, stay calm, stay polite, don't throw blame around, just find the best way to resolve the situation.

Going back to pre-emptively anticipating fear-inducing situations, one you'll surely have for at least one project during your time as a web project manager, if not every project, is resourcing issues. The client will expect you to be flexible enough to accommodate their delays in delivering materials or feedback without impacting final deadlines. You will be expected to allocate people to project work despite not having a clear grasp of the scope, and in the face of a slipping deadline and a shrinking budget. You must, however, **never** admit or even complain to anyone about not having enough resources. It will only serve to annoy your team, your client manager, your boss, the client, damaging relationships that you rely on. Furthermore, it's probably not entirely true even if you don't realise it. Unfortunately, it's usually your concern and nobody else's. The client certainly doesn't need to hear it - you don't expect to go into a restaurant as a customer, place your order, and then be told the chef can't cook your meal because they don't have the time or the ingredients. Instead you might be told that something is off the menu or that it will take time to prepare. You might change your order, you might go to another restaurant, or you might wait patiently and enjoy the meal that you are served.

There are some techniques you can employ to deal with resourcing issues when your team is stretched beyond its capability. Essentially though what they come down to is just buying time and accurately prioritising individual tasks. Luckily, as a project manager that's what you're best at. Never confirm or commit to anything until you've thoroughly checked it against budget and schedules. When new requests come in, they may actually improve on the agreed functionality or feature set to the point that they're really worth trying for the sake of the project's success, no matter the strain it will put you under. On the other hand if you can put a case for the increased time and money required the project owner may reconsider and deem it not worth it before withdrawing the request. You could try squeezing the requested work into the existing schedule, which would mean asking your team to work overtime in return for some promised compensation. Or you could just assign it to one person who you deem fit for the job, the hero who has to “take one for the team”. Alternatively you could rely on the advice and ingenuity of your team of experts. Make the task description as clear as possible and involve them in resolving the matter. Maybe there are other tasks that can be shuffled around, postponed, or better distributed. It's also important to consider what the task involves and therefore who would be capable of taking it on. Is it a specialist job or might you yourself be able to dip your hands in? Even if you're not entirely up to the task you may be able to seek help from a team member, learning something along the way and impressing them with your altruism. Or otherwise maybe everybody can chip in a little of their time so that everyone shares the load.

## Getting things done

> This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember: all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.

> -_Morpheus_

You arrive at the office at 0930 with your day fully planned out. You finish your caffeinated beverage, catch up on a few articles, and prepare to start work. It's 0950 and you've already received 10 e-mails, the client manager has been lingering around your desk, and you have a team of designers and developers waiting for your briefing before you can start work, all of which demands presidence over your scheduled work. Should have taken the blue pill.

One of the biggest challenges of project management is learning how to deal with several trillion things each day, approximately. Gone are the days of sitting down with a code editor and spending a day quietly tapping out some new algorithms, or playing around with typefaces on a blank canvas until you have that smug feeling of visual satisfaction. Every project is different. Every team is different. Yet somehow you have to stay on top of everything and maintain the steady pace of progress, like the burly drummer at the front of a dragon boat struggling through choppy waters.

One approach to this daunting challenge was conceived by David Allen and is accompanied by the tagline “The Art of Stress Free Productivity”. It probably won't leave you stress free - you're still a project manager and stress is par for the course - but you will certainly be more organised and equipped to deal with your gargantuan task list after adopting this system. While we're not going to cover the system in detail here - you may want to go get the book for that - we can at least go into a few points that are useful for web project managers specifically.

The main idea is to break down tasks into their smallest possible units, then organise and categorise them as “next actions” or “waiting for” items. This will help ensure you never forget to complete a task no matter how many other things you have to action, how long it's been since you last thought about it, or how small it is to other issues at hand. Everyone will want to spend time getting used to implementing this system and tweak it to their own ends. You'll need a tool like Gmail, Things, Evernote, or something capable of recording and categorising notes and tasks - devise your own system to do the following:

* Scan through all your emails at the start of the day. Anything that requires you to do something, mark it as a TODO (i.e. “next action”) and drag it to a TODO folder. 
* Anything that does not require an action should be read and archived into a project folder.
* If an e-mail contains something that requires you to wait for something from someone else before you can action it then categorise it as “waiting” and drag it to a WAITING folder.
* If an email contains something that you were waiting for, then immediately edit the corresponding item in the WAITING folder and then move it to the TODO folder.
* If an email can be replied to quickly and easily and will help someone else out or help move the project forward, then it's minimal effort from you so just reply immediately and instinctively, then archive it into the appropriate project folder, or if you need to wait for a reply then move it to the WAITING folder.


After doing this, you should have reached the fabled "inbox zero". Having an empty e-mail box does wonders for your stress levels, offering releif and a very real sense of accomplishment. Go get yourself another caffeinated beverage as a reward.

Now what?

Now you should go through your TODO list and prioritise them. The first item on your list each day should be the team briefing or daily standup meeting. We'll get to that later. Next thing is to go through your WAITING list to see if you need to send any reminders to anyone that they may be able to work on during the course of the day, allowing you to move the action to your TODO list as soon as possible. All that's left for the day is to go through your TODO list. If you get so many emails every day that you can't deal with them as they come in, or such that it would take too long to organise all your tasks within the first half hour of your day, then you may want to regroup in the afternoon and spend some more time going through your lists. List-making is the project manager's forté.

### Dealing with Interruptions

The client may call out of the blue, the client manager may still be lingering around your desk or bouldering over every 10 minutes. Your production team may be throwing questions at you left right and centre. Meanwhile, your eye keeps flicking towards your enormous TODO list. Stay calm.

There are two things to do here. First is to have your handy lists on handy. Make a mental note of where you're at in what you're doing, stop, and give your time and full concentration to whoever is requesting it. Not only is it your job, but everyone will like you for it and be more understanding when you make demands on their precious time. With your lists at the ready, any actions that come up during your conversation can be put straight on the TODO list. At the end of the conversation why not take advantage of the situation and check through your WAITING list to see if there's anything this person can help you with? Maybe you can close off some issues that can help the project move forward. This will also clearly demonstrate to whoever you're dealing with that you are on top of the situation, giving them confidence in your project management capabilities.

### What You Need

#### Clear & Realistic Specifications

You've received the project specifications from the client or the client manager and you're starting to break it down into tasks and phases. It'll inevitably start to dawn on you that the deliverables are too ambiguous or that there doesn't seem to be enough time or budget or available skills to deliver the project successfully. Right now you're the only one that knows this and you get a lump in your throat. You're going to have to let the client know. Your immediate instinct is to push back or try to redefine the project scope. This is going to lose you some valuable trust points and give the client a negative impression of you right from the start.

You're going to need to try and resolve the situation and establish a project scope that you can confidently deliver. In other words, don't bitch and moan about it, but rather try one of the following to ensure you always get specifications that you can work with:

* Ensure that you are always involved in the pre-sales process
* Explain clearly and honestly the difficulty that the current scope puts you and your team in
* Meticulously track time spent on each project phase that the sales team or client manager can use as a reference in future
* Involve the client manager throughout the project lifecycle to help them gain an understanding of what's involved

If you have any problems with the project specifications, raise it with the relevant people early and in a professional manner, and try to suggest solutions. A really great specification should allow you and your team to under sell and over deliver.

#### Adequate Time

Aside from how long the project itself will take is how long it will take you to manage it. Unfortunately, this is almost impossible to estimate and only gets easier with experience. Ideally you'll only be managing one project at a time but it may be the case that you have to handle multiple projects. This may be achieveable as long as your multiple projects are all staggered at different phases. Don't start more than one project at the same time.

Most importantly, if at any stage you feel you don't have enough time to adequately manage your workload, raise it immediately. You are at risk of losing control of the project, which will only serve to increase your workload and stress levels, and you will inevitably take the brunt of the blame if the project fails to be a success.

As with web designers and developers, if we have enough time to do our jobs properly web project managers feel more confident of delivering high quality projects and that’s what makes us happy.

#### Trust and Confidence

As we discussed above, trust from the client, the client manager, your boss, and every member of the production team is crucial. You are on the front-lines, making critical decisions on a daily basis. The success or failure of the entire project largely falls on your shoulders and yet your job relies on so many uncontrollable factors. Good project management doesn't necessarily lead to project success, but bad project management always leads to project failure. Trust can only be gained and isn't given blindly. You gain it by demonstrating that you can do your job effectively, take control, and always, always accept responsibility.

#### A Capable Production Team

In your role you simply don't have the time to do everything yourself, or even to help out with content, design, development and testing, on top of everything else. You need to be able to confidently delegate tasks and know that they will be completed to your standards of quality, and also resist the temptation to even think that something would have been done better if you'd just done it yourself. Relying on the skills of your team is essential and so that means not just hiring well but also maintaining and developing skills - the better your team gets the easier your job becomes and the better your products are.

You should absolutely be involved in the hiring process. If you're not, start kicking and screaming until you are. Nobody knows better than you what skillsets your team may be lacking and what are in surplus, nor is anyone else in a better position to assess how well a candidate will fit into your team. Chances are you've done design or development work previously so you can accurately assess candidates' breadth and depth of knowledge. You can find more useful advice about hiring & firing in _Chapter 3 - Production Directors_. Remember though, as we talked about previously, not to be resource greedy. Perhaps you don't need to hire someone new if an existing team member can be trained up.

> Developers often treat PM as The Source of All Evil. And to some point they’re right. It’s a project manager who brings more work. It’s a project manager who bugs everyone asking when they’re going to be done.

> _- Pawel Brodzinski_

You have to expect a lot of support from your team, but that means you have to provide it as well. An atmosphere of mutual support is what you're going for here - if you scratch their backs they'll scratch yours. The support you provide may come in many forms. After you delegate tasks, always make yourself available to answer questions and provide encouragement. Never just dump a load of work on someone and disappear. Sometimes, get them started yourself if you can. A few lines of code, some basic wireframes, or some lines of copy may go a long way to show humility, that you're not above the work of others. In doing so you're setting an example and might even learn something if they can provide feedback on your work, leading to a better mutual understanding. As with clients or directors who like to micromanage, my advise is to leave it to the experts and those whose role is there specifically for completing such tasks. You need to respect and actively seek their skills, knowledge, and advice.
 
Thank them and recognise their efforts publicly, but always offer your own criticism and advice privately. Even if they are performing well, it's your job to push them to always be better. Constantly encourage them to learn new tools and techniques, give them the time for training to practice what they've learned. Of course, you need to take this into account when formulating schedules and conjuring deadlines. It will pay off in the long run as they learn to work more efficiently and can accommodate a greater variety of requests. That means fewer bottlenecks for you.

Ultimately, no matter whether you always manage to hire industry wizards or not, your team will only ever be as productive are you enable them to be, which leads us nicely onto the next section.

## Facilitating Others

Your role basically covers the following:

* requirements analysis
* scheduling
* budgeting
* task delegation
* monitoring & reviews
* documentation
* training

Let's pigeonhole your production team into content managers, designers, developers, and testers. They are all highly skilled experts with very specific remits. You need to keep them focused on what they are there do, which is hopefully also what they do best and what they enjoy most. Nothing will destroy their passion, productivity, and morale quicker than having them involved in other parts of the project beyond those remits. For example, asking a developer to do content population, or asking a designer to write headlines, or indeed asking anyone to fill out timesheets...

### Keeping them focused

Of course there are times when everyone is going to have to do minor tasks in support of project management. Yes, timesheets, but also planning meetings, their own internal schedules, answering phone calls and emails etc. You have to do everything you can to minimise the impact of such tasks so that they don't cause people to get sidetracked such that quality is reduced and the project momentum is dampened. Even if just one person is suffering more than others under the weight of unread emails, the effectiveness of the entire team is affected.

So how can you help? Be a stress sponge. Back to the e-mail example, ensure you are copied in on all project-related e-mails. Yep, all of them. That way you have an eye on to whom issues are being directed and can step in if needs be. By reducing their stress, they work better, which means that eventually you have less to be stressed about. So the stress dividends pay off later.

> It should be assumed that part of the role is to basically take crap on behalf of your team in such a way that they don’t even get a whiff of it, even if they’re the cause of it. Your job is to keep your team positive, motivated and focussed on their job – and if this means taking some crap you know you don’t deserve then so be it.

> _- Sam Barnes_

You also need to shield your team from information that they personally don't need to worry about. In the same way, your boss isn't troubling you with the organisation's overall financial situation, the office space rent, employee health cover, taxes etc. Anything client-related, for instance, can stay between you and the client manager. Anything code-related can filter down to the developer. Sam Barnes' crap analogy is an excellent one. He goes on to note that if you can't take the crap then you have no place in any management role. So when e-mails come your way containing issues that you may need to seek help on, first try to identify the core problem or question - you may need to translate or simplify the message to make it easier for the recipient. Never just forward emails or specifications. This is expecially true of bug reports - chances are the client's language will appear commical at best to any developer, and confusing at worst. If you can identify the bug yourself, write the report more accurately and concisely, and go on to provide accomanying screenshots, then your developer will be able to dive right in. Better yet, if you can identify the cause of the bug yourself then you not only help them out considerably but you may also learn something new or maintain your own skills.

Never mislabel an issue as urgent unless it really, really is. Again, you should try and absorb the stress as much as possible. If something can possibly wait, and the chances are it probably can, then let it wait until the end of an interation or sprint or at least a suitable gap in the work. If something really is urgent, then do everything you can to reduce its impact - put more people on it or try and step in to help with it yourself. Especially don't label something as urgent just because it will help with your own scheduling - that's transferring your stress onto others.

Consider when it's appropriate to disturb people. Get to know your team, when they are most productive and when they might be able to handle short interruptions. Limit scheduling meetings to the start of the day and never drag someone into a meeting where they are not required for the entire duration. Arranging group meetings, such as daily standups, can be a great way for every to quickly provide everyone else with an update on their status. If in part of a meeting you find there are one or two small things you need someone for, take a note and get back to whoever's asking once you have the answer later. Again, if it's something small then wait until that person is on a break or clearly available to talk.

Lastly, if it looks like someone is approaching burnout or is doing too much overtime, give them a break. Even in the face of looming deadlines and everyone is under pressure, it's better that you take the flak yourself from your client or boss. Tired and stressed team members do not produce their best work, which will in the end be detrimental to the product. Reaching actual burnout will just mean a longer recovery time before they can be productive again, further impacting the project. As Sam Barnes said, you just have to take the crap yourself.

### Be a team player

Put yourself on the same level, and never consider yourself in charge or in any way perched on a pedestal somewhere above the other team members.

Be humble, and willing to forgo the glory and recognition for your efforts. Johnny Ive may get the credit for Apple's impeccable product design, but he has a team of 80,000 people working behind the scenes at California all focused on making Apple products the best they can be. Let the star designers and devlopers and developers have their glory, let praise be adorned over the beauty and the functionality, but remain smug in the knowledge that if you weren't there everything would completely fall apart. If you have a team of 10 people, then feel those 10 pats on your back. 

Stand up for your team members. Be willing to push back on clients, your boss, or other teams if more time is needed or if requests simply can't be met. And always defend them to your bosses, even if they have made mistakes; never blame them for anything. Any mistakes or failures are always those of the team and it's your job to find a mitigating solution.

### Give them what they need

Exactly what they need. Nothing more, nothing less. At the start of each project spend as much time as you need pouring through the specs and requirements, filtering, summarising, and categorising:

#### Content Managers

* What is or should be the tone of the organisation? What should their voice sound like if they were a person? What is their industry and who are their competitors?
* Who will be providing the copy? Us? Them? Who will be maintaining it going forward and what tools might they need to do so?
* What is the content breakdown? Blog posts? Product listings? etc. Are there any potential rich data models?
* What is the rough scale of the content? How many posts or product listings? etc.
* Who is the target demographic?
* How/when/where will the content be consumed? What is the nature of the web project?
* What languages will be supported?
* What are the accessibility requirements?
* What are the target keywords?
* What format should copy be supplied in?
* Is a CMS required? What content types should be static and which dynamic?

#### Designers

* What is the theme of the organisation? Brand colours, typefaces, brand style guide etc.
* Who is the target demographic?
* What are the supported platforms for the web project? What are the performance considerations?
* What are the client's personal style preferences?
* What is the tone of the content being presented?
* Who will provide imagery or what are the guidelines around imagery?

#### Developers

* What are the supported platforms and devices?
* What is the required functionality?
* What is the performance budget?
* Is a content management system required? How much dynamic content will there be?
* Will any data be drawn from external sources?

#### Testers

* What are the supported platforms for the web project?
* What is the performance budget?
* What is the UI style guide?

#### Everyone

* What's the deadline?!?

You'll note that of the requirements listed above, the content managers will need the most up-front, because their work will be the bulk of the beginning phase of the project. Content first, remember. Following that is the designers' requirements, followed by the developers' and testers'. That is because design is to some extent dependent on content, and development is similarly dependent on design, while testing is of course dependent on everything. That is not to say though they they are not all interdependent, nor that they should be executed independently in a waterfall model, but we'll get to that later.

What we've covered so far in this section is by no means exhaustive and indeed every team or web professional may have their own individual requirements. What's important is that you take the information you have, identify and investigate any gaps, and tease out specifically what you need to share with who. Even after you've reviewed the details of a new project yourself, approach each team member or team lead individually and find out what else they might need. There will be items on which you will need their feedback in order to formulate your budgets and schedules. Only once everyone has all the required information at hand, or at least as much as can possibly be provided, are you ready to kick off and deliver your plan.

### Adaptive communication

You need to be able to communicate with everyone involved in the project **on their level**. Perhaps your hands-on experience will equip you with the ability to talk details with designers or developers, but you need to be able to speak a different language when taking the same conversation to someone else, like a client for instance. Not just your use of jargon, you'll also need to carefully consider your overall approach, your language, your tone.

Designers and developers especially might be quite territorial and defensive of their work and so any comments, feedback, or requests must be framed delicately so that you convey trust in their skills and abilities. If you say anything, even accidentally, that makes them feel belittled or reduced to the status of pixel pusher or code monkey then motivation is instantly crushed and the project will suffer. This takes practice and it pays off to be open about your approach to conversation, especially with people you haven't worked with much before, by asking directly if what you're saying seems totally reasonable and always asking if they have their own comments or suggestions.

While with designers you might want to use inspecific language, allowing their creativity to flourish, developers will want logical and straightforward speak. Similarly, while you can jest with the designers about certain “comic” typefaces, or with developers about the web browser that always gives them problems (you know the one I'm talking about!), your clients, client managers, and bosses on the other hand are no interested in the implementation details, no matter how proud you are of them, and just want to hear about decisions, progress, results, and impact. Remember that no personality trait is negative in all circumstances, save say predilection to constant outrage, and as part of your role as the linchpin holding the team together you must be able to adapt to and bring together each individual.







## Assemble the Team
### Roles & Responsibilities

### Team Cohesion

Web Project Managers work in one of the fastest moving industries out there. As soon as one technology is launched and stable another new alternative is released. Web design and development trends are in constant flux, what was a cool and effective solution one day is inefficient and out-dated the next, and I bet I’m not alone when I say that each time a new project starts someone on your team will suggest using a new design trend or technology.

Add to that the nature of running a business where cash flow is critical, other projects can knock your carefully thought out plan sideways or a key client ring up with urgent requests that require resource you booked months in advance, and you have a delicate situation indeed.

While web trends and technologies evolve around us at a rapid rate and business requirements can often change on a week by week basis, a Web Project Manger will have to make constant decisions on what solutions to ultimately deliver to the client and often these decisions will not please everyone involved in the agency or project.

So who are these people and why may they not be happy bunnies?

WHO YOU MAY ANNOY AS A WEB PM
In short, as a Web Project Manager, making final decisions about which solutions to implement, the chances are at some point you will annoy absolutely everyone who is involved in projects… not an appealing part of the job, but sometimes a necessary and unavoidable one.

The Project Manager can’t ensure that they’ll be loved by everyone – nor do they want to be. They aspire to be well respected by the customer, but even that can’t always be guaranteed no matter how well they perform and manage the project. But, the Project Manager can ensure that everything that is expected of them is being performed well and if that doesn’t always do it for the customer at least it should be noticed by the delivery organization.
Brad Egeland, Reputation is a Fragile Thing

But before you get scared and begin to re-think that career move into web project management, let’s look briefly at what each team member generally wants from all projects.

EMPATHISE AND UNDERSTANDING
Empathy and an understanding of the business forces driving different people’s motives are key skills required by any Web Project Manager as it enables you to appreciate other perspectives when making project decisions.

Let’s take a look at the usual suspects, who they are and what they want from web projects and your web project management. *Stereotype disclaimer included afterwards.

WEB AGENCY DIRECTORS
A web agency director wants the project completed on time, on budget, to a quality level that is fitting to the web agency and with the client feeling happy, wanting more work and willing to give referrals to potential clients.

FINANCE DIRECTORS
A finance director wants the project milestones split up in such a way that cash flow/collection is maintained for the business and thus that the project is completed to schedule, on time and on budget.

WEB DESIGNERS
Web designers want to push the boundaries with each design, creating designs that make the client happy, are worthy of the web agency’s portfolio and any web design showcase site.

WEB DEVELOPERS
Web Developers want to use the latest technologies in order to implement the most efficient solution possible and keep the web agency on the cutting edge of the industry.

WEB PROJECT CLIENTS
Clients want to receive a website that is as future proof as possible and facilitates them being able to achieve their short and long-term business aims. Unless otherwise informed, they will assume the website has been built to excellent standards but probably won’t care what doctype has been used so long as it looks and works perfectly for their users.

WEB PROJECT MANAGERS
In the middle of everyone is the Web Project Manager, and he or she will want, and often be expected, to meet ALL of the expectations above. But if you work with other Web Project Managers they will want your project to run on time so that their own projects can also be on schedule.

A Web Project Manager who's face is covered in post-it notesWeb Project Managers: In the middle of everyone
Cool, that’s everyone nice and neatly packaged and stereotyped, so why is it not always possible to please everyone, and as a Web Project Manager, how can you try to make sure everyone’s as happy as possible?

CONSIDER, ANALYSE AND COMMUNICATE
It is vitally important to understand that, in most cases, everyone’s intentions are good! They are always geared towards delivering a great project and growing their companies!

Understanding this first fact is crucial when you’re being pulled in every direction trying to keep people happy. Failure to understand this results in a very defensive posture when challenged and that usually leads to bad things.

When you have to make a web project decision the key is to always:

Consider everyone’s perspective, goals and motives
Analyse and make a decision
Communicate why you made the decision
This sounds simple and thus you would think it easy to articulate in a paragraph, but after trying to do just that and failing quite dramatically, in much the same way as Greedo tried to apprehend Han Solo, it seems best to illustrate the point using a few scenarios Web Project Managers face every day.

DEVELOPER: “LET’S USE A NEW TECHNOLOGY”
You have the client requirements, you communicate this to the development team and you hear the phrase you know both excites and scares you…

“We could use [insert_new_web_technology_here] for that feature.” – It’s time to and make a decision.

The first step is to consider why the developer is suggesting to use a new technology as opposed to the one the agency has experience using – it will generally be for one of the following reasons:

The new technology has the potential to be far more performance efficient than the current one
Using the new technology will mean less repetitive work in the future
The developer fancies trying out (playing with) the new technology
Next a Web Project Manager should analyse if using the new technology is a decision that will improve the project, web agency and/or client’s chances of meeting their business aims.

To do this it is important to make sure you fully understand the technology in question so you can assess the potential benefits and risks.

In order to make a decision a Web Project Manager needs one or all of the following because ultimately you are 100% responsible for the project’s outcome:

Experience in the technology being put forward as a possible solution
The aptitude and willingness to research the proposed solution
Absolute trust in team members to make the right decision
Once you understand the technology, assess it against the project and decide if the long-term benefits justify going for it and then communicate your decision and reasons why to your team.

If you choose to go for it then you should communicate the possible benefits of using it to your boss and add the caveat that it is adding a certain risk to the project and thus could cause some overrun. Of course you may be overruled, but if you think it’s worth it, put your case forward and do everything you can to make sure the benefits are clearly visible.

If you choose to reject the idea you should do more than just say “no” to the development team, instead communicate to them the reasons why you are making this decision, which could include:

Using the new technology brings too much risk to what is already a fragile client relationship that needs complete stability right now
You feel the advantages of the new technology are not strong enough when compared to the current stable one you use
The new technology is not mature enough to be used on a high-profile site
The cross browser compatibility is not broad enough to warrant use
The project budget is already extremely tight
It’s quite possible that, even after explaining your reasons, team members will still be unhappy and you will get the shaking heads and sighs that translate as “This Web Project Manager is really stuck in his ways and is holding this agency back technically!” It’s at times like this you just need to have a thick skin and have absolute conviction in your decision.

As I’ve said before, as a Web Project Manager you are responsible for the entire outcome of the project and thus the client satisfaction, deadlines, budgets, agency cash flow, reputation and whole host of other business critical factors – the technical solutions provided are the complete focus of the developers, but in the grand scheme of things only one part of many and you are the one with the complete overview.

Communicating this to the development team regularly will hopefully raise their awareness to this fact and make them more commercially aware, and that can only be a good thing for any web agency.

ALWAYS PLAYING SAFE
As a little side note however, making the ‘safest’ decision is not always the best move, sometimes it’s best to just go for it even if you think the chances of success are smaller than you’d like…

This is how web agencies move forward, by occasionally throwing caution to the wind, taking risks and pushing the boundaries! If it works, you and your team are great, if it doesn’t, blame will be laid squarely with you – but hey, as a Web Project Manager you should be used to this situation right ;-) and better to have given it a go than always play safe!

MD: “WHY ARE WE GOING OVER BUDGET?”
Oh the words any Web Project Manager fears… it inherently is coupled with the assumption the project has been managed poorly and thus you should be hung, drawn and quartered. On some occasions this is exactly the case and it’s best to just admit it, learn from it and try to make sure the same mistakes aren’t made again – it happens to us all, its how we become better.

However, on the odd occasion a Web Project Manager has consciously made decisions that they knew would cause the project to overrun, but in doing so have achieved, or gone part way to achieve, a web agency’s business goal that aligns with the long-term strategy.

Examples of this include using web project tasks or phases to:

Train a team member in a new skill and/or give them experience
Develop new web project management processes
Create a stunning agency portfolio site
Develop a new re-usable plug-in for a CMS
Make a very important client very happy
Of course an agency would ideally be able to satisfy all of these requirements on a regular basis within project timelines and budgets, but let’s face it this isn’t always possible so you have to grab any opportunity you can and go for it – remember, over budget doesn’t always mean zero profit.

The important things are to consider if this is the right task, project, client account or time in the business’s life to go over budget by using your knowledge of all four to analyse the best course of action.

If your analysis leads you to the conclusion it is worth it, then communicate to the big boss man (or lady), preferably before you announce the decision to the team, that this is why you went, or are heading, over budget on this particular project, but, the agency now has a:

Trained up team member who has a new skill that can be utilised on future projects
Happy team member who feels they are growing in experience and skill
More refined and efficient web project management process
Website or web application that will ‘wow’ potential clients and makes the whole agency proud
New, or vastly improved, CMS feature plug-in that can be deployed in minutes rather than hours
Great chance for repeat account business and glowing referrals
If you can communicate the reasons you made a decision that meant your project overran and demonstrate that it will provide a potential viable amount of return on investment, more than the over budget time spent, you should get the thumbs up and it’s full steam ahead.

CLIENT: “I WANT TO ADD A NEW FEATURE”
Words from a web project client you could almost bet your life savings on hearing at least once per project and after all functionality has been agreed upon and budgeted for in terms of money and resource allocation.

However, in order to shy slightly away from the traditional Waterfall project management methodology, a Web Project Manager’s response to requests like these should never be an instant “no” because a specification has been signed off for several reasons:

They could have additional budget and be willing to extend the project’s timeline in order to fit the new feature in
Other parts of the project may be ahead of schedule and under budget, leaving room for additional work
They may be willing to sacrifice a previously agreed feature to get the new one in
There may be an alternative and quick to implement solution that will see the same aims achieved
The feature in question may be one your web agency have been thinking about developing before to sell to other clients
“No” should only ever be the words you use if after analysing the request it is deemed in no way possible
Before making any decisions a Web Project Manager should first consider why the client is asking for this feature and why now.

The common response to these requests is to huff and puff about how typical of a client this is, assume they are being cheeky and trying to squeeze the web agency as much as possible etc. But, for the most part, clients are savvy business people who know their industry, market and target audience better than you and thus the late feature request could well be a reaction to something happening in their field that makes a seemingly daft request quite a sensible one.

Start by having a discussion with the client about why they want this new feature, more importantly what business reason or web project KPI they feel it will help to satisfy.

Once you have fully considered why the client has made the request, the next step should be to analyse if the new feature:

Will help the client’s business or project aims
Can be completed under the current budget, timelines and required resources are available
Would require additional budget or timeline extension
Could be re-sold to other clients
Once you have analysed the information and made a decision, you should then communicate it to the client.

If you decide to allow the feature in the client will be over the moon and they’ll love you to bits, sweet.

If you decide that the feature should/will not be allowed in, then you will get a mixed bag of reactions depending on the client, but how you communicate this decision can influence the reaction immensely!

Take the client through your decision making process step by step, explain to them the hours you estimate the new feature would take just cannot be accommodated unless they agree to provide further funding or sacrifice another project deliverable, or how the feature would probably not in fact achieve what they would hope it too – the more transparent you are about your decision making process when communicating the decision, the more understanding you’ll generally find the client to be.

Learning how to say “no” to a client is an art form for most Web Project Managers.

GUARANTEED HAPPINESS FOR ONE AND ALL?
Web Project Managers are constantly pulled in every direction by everyone – they are always in the middle of everyone and their priorities. It requires a great deal of strength, understanding and negotiation skills to be able to deal with these pressures and end the project with all parties feeling positive – remember Web Project Managers’ motives are also always focussed on delivering value, not only for the client, but their web agency as well.

By following the consider, analyse and communicate decision making process during web projects will not always result in happiness for everyone involved, but being honest and transparent about how you reached the decision and why you believe it is the right one for the project, web agency and client should go some way to reducing any friction that could be caused otherwise.

o whenever I’m sitting down to play a little game of FIFA with a good friend of mine and I tell him I’m currently drafting an article, he replies with sarcasm:

Is it about how to manage clients? Or maybe how to spot bad clients? Or what about how to handle client meetings? You could do an article that was more client-focussed.

I then let him beat me at FIFA so he doesn’t go to bed crying. However, as much as it pains me to say it, he does make a good point.

There are an awful lot of web project management articles out there that are focussed on client management, as well as estimating, scope creep and budgets etc. but one area that is often overlooked is what part a Web Project Manager can play in team management.

My next series of articles will focus more on the internal aspects of web project management.

This article focuses on why and how a Web Project Manager should resolve common issues that cause internal team conflicts that ultimately stall web projects and lower team morale.

DYSFUNCTIONAL DIGITAL FAMILIES
Web designers hate developers, developers whine about designers and both bitch about the Web Project Managers – this is the stereotypical view of the relationship between these three parts of a web project team that resembles what social workers would undoubtedly call a dysfunctional digital family.

An old sepia picture of a man and two women in hysterics with laughterWhy can’t we just all get along like this?
The reasons for these notoriously frosty relationships have been well documented over time in articles such as:

Two Cats in a Sack: Designer-Developer Discord
Why Project Managers are a Barrier for Designers
However, as my comments in the latter article suggests, I believe the reasons for issues all boil down to four things:

Conflicting priorities
Arrogance
Lack of competence
Low awareness of the bigger picture
Guess what, these four things are here to stay and as well as having to manage multiple web projects, several clients, a handful of suppliers and even your boss to some extent – I sincerely believe it’s down to the Web Project Manager to also manage these aspects of a digital team dynamics.

As some of you may be thinking right now “Why me!?”, well here’s why…

WEB PROJECT MANAGERS: IT’S YOUR JOB
The simple answer to why it should be you, is because as a Web Project Manager you are responsible for the successful delivery of the web project and failure to manage the four issues will almost certainly result in either web project failure or a lower quality result than it could’ve been.

Not only are you responsible, but you’re often the only person with the full overview of the situation and thus are best placed to start resolution and below are some approaches to each.

CONFLICTING PRIORITIES
As a Web Project Manager you are smack bang in the middle of web projects. Your boss just wants the project to go well, the client wants what they paid for, designers want to produce something they can be proud of and developers want to create elegant efficient code that solves the problem.

A photograph of a cute little dog pulling on a bright pink toy while looking directly into the cameraYou have to manage bitches like this and their priorities
Unfortunately these priorities often clash and this is where the problems start, but the resolution approach is generally the same…

First you must understand the priorities of each party, then empathise completely, and finally educate all on everyone else’s priorities and feelings – and you have to do so in a way that leaves each party empathetic to all sides of the equation and willing to compromise.

To effectively achieve this you have to believe and champion the notion that no one is looking to screw anyone else over and all parties are just looking to produce the best thing they can – and you know what, this isn’t fantasy land, this is pretty much always the case but for some reason it’s rarely communicated.

ARROGANCE
We’ve all met them, the arrogant designer, developer and even the occasional arrogant Web Project Manager :)

They think they know it all and when challenged they see it as almost an insult, dig their heels in and seemingly set out on a mission to be as obstructive as possible to a smooth web project process.

A photograph of a bird's head as he looks all superiorLook at him, he so thinks he’s it!
However the truth is, pride and a high level of skill mixed with confidence is often mistaken for just arrogance. But whether these people are good or not is irrelevant really when it comes to eliminating this as a cause of web project problems.

Your mission is to remove barriers to momentum and get things going again and so, when faced with an arrogant team member just take them to one side and talk to them with respect about what their issues are – and when I say talk to them, really talk and more importantly listen first, and then once you’ve fully understood their issues make sure they know you’ve understood and then proceed to explain how all you want to do is move things forward.

Try offering up parallel issues that another team has with the project, try to make them appreciate it’s not just them in a bit of a situation and then finally make sure to leave the room with a deal that removes the barrier.

LACK OF COMPETENCE
Sometimes a designer will hate a developer for putting the brakes on a design element that would require certain rocket science functionality, or a developer will get annoyed with a designer because a PSD has been poorly organised – while these situations can arise due to poor communication or squeezed time, it can also be a simple case of a lack of competence.

A photograph of a white furry-faced toy with a gormless look on his face“Seriously guys, I swear I did it right this time, ya feel me?”
In either case there is one sure fire way to make matters worse and that’s to bitch and whine with either party about the other. Instead of enflaming the issue look at positive ways to solve it.

Immediately quell any slating of anyone and start to guide the conversation to a vibe of “Ok, how are we going to fix this now and make sure it doesn’t happen again”. Again, by default take the position that the person who has caused issues with low competence probably meant well and what’s needed is education not crucifixion.

Get the two parties together and facilitate a little informal session on why this element causes issues and what approach can be taken in the future to reduce them.

You’d be surprised how quickly the tone turns from spiteful and toxic to something a little more positive and constructive when a Web Project Manager gets two people together and facilitates a little education session, that leaves both parties feeling a little bit more empathetic towards the other.

LOW AWARENESS OF THE BIGGER PICTURE
Aside from conflicting priorities this is probably the most common reason for internal squabbling on digital teams and having been on the production side myself I can think back to when I was the biggest culprit.

I would build a site in superbly clean front-end code and then get annoyed when I was told there was no time to ensure the site passed a heap of accessibility checkpoints, be it through testers or by human testing – outrageous!!

A photograph of an office worker with glasses and an afro style hairstyle peeking out behind a monitor with a toy gun“Oh no you didn’t just ask me to use inline CSS!!!”
Despite meaning well and knowing what best practice was I just didn’t understand that from a commercial standpoint that there just wasn’t the budget to allow me to do this. The mistake my manager at the time made was not to explain this to me in a way I could understand – I was totally peed off and thought he didn’t care about best practice.

From experiences like this I learnt that in similar design or development situations where a Web Project Manager will make a decision that makes production teams vomit, it’s important that you communicate that you’re fully aware it’s not best practice and then move onto explain why you’ve made the decision.

It really annoys me when any management person talks about production teams as if they don’t care about the commercial side of business, or even worse, wouldn’t understand it – bullshit.

Web designers and developers are very smart people and if they’re talked to as such I’ve yet to find one that doesn’t end up appreciating why they have to ‘code it dirty’ from time to time. No, it doesn’t make them happy to do so, nor will it stop the same frustrations next time as these people have passion and pride, but it does get the job done and compliance should always be rewarded on a future web project with some breathing space to do the right thing.

I genuinely believe if a production team member seems to not care about the bigger picture, his manager or Web Project Manager has simply not found the right way to communicate it and they should keep trying before assuming the worst of the person.

SUMMARY
While there are many more common issues experienced within digital teams, the main points I wanted to get across are that as a Web Project Manager you should see it as your responsibility to try and resolve any issues that are causing problems with your web projects.

Please do not immediately go bleating to your manager or colleagues about these issues, first try and resolve them yourself.

Running to your manager each time not only puts more on their already busy plates, but it also loses you massive respect points from your team, the very people you’re meant to be leading and keeping motivated to work for you – the manager route should be your last point of call, not first.

Always start by being empathetic to Jedi levels when any issues arise. So often I see in-house fighting between two parties that turns nasty when all along both just wanted to do what they saw as the right thing – stop it before it turns nasty by genuinely (not falsely) listening and understanding the reasons for the feelings – a powerful weapon in the Web Project Manager’s arsenal is the ability to empathise where others cannot.

Make sure to resolve each conflict with education. This education could take many forms, be it on the skills front or business angle, but make sure that by the end of it all parties involved have a heightened awareness to the feelings of others and increased knowledge on how to avoid it next time.










## Make a Plan

WHO SHOULD DEFINE KPIS
It is important to specify who should create the web project’s KPIs? Usually the client will give you the KPIs but it is the web agency’s role to analyse and challenge these where necessary to ensure they are realistic, measurable and placed in the correct context e.g. if a KPI is given to as “appear on page one of Google” without the context of which keywords to appear on page one for, the KPI could be achieved by getting the client to number one for their domain name, brilliant.

Obviously this is not brilliant, but illustrates the importance of defining the right kind of KPIs.

FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN CAPTURING AND MEASURING KPIS
Another factor to take into consideration when defining and capturing KPIs is what the client’s business activity is that time that could impact any of the metrics collected both before and after launch.

For example, if a KPI was to increase traffic by 5%, a ‘before’ figure would be collected that gave the current traffic over a defined period, let’s say three months. Post-launch, the ‘after’ figure would be collected for the same time duration and the comparison made. But using just this one example could possibly result in skewed results if any of the following are true:

When the ‘before’ metric was taken the client had just implemented a print marketing campaign
PPC/SEM was being conducted and now is not
The ‘after’ metric is taken over a period of time when several national holidays occur
A new competitor arises on the scene before project completion
There are many factors that should be taken into considering when capturing and measuring web project KPIs. It is impossible to predict the future, but by conducting research into any external factors increases the chance of being able to produce the most equally weighted comparative metrics and thus the purest measurement for a KPI and the project’s success.

STAYING FOCUSSED ON KPIS
Once defined with the client at the start of the project, the KPIs should be documented and circulated amongst all parties that will be involved throughout the project’s lifecycle. In doing so you are immediately focussing everyone on the aims of the project. Too often in web projects the aims of the project are specified in finite detail by the client in the tender document, backed up by agency proposals and then swiftly forgotten by both sides. While this seems a little crazy, in reality, the pace and complexity of most projects, both large and small, make it difficult to focus on anything other than completion – it’s the job of the web project manager to ensure these aims are at the forefront of everyone’s mind at all times.

The most effective ways to keep KPI focus throughout a project are to:

Document them at the start of the project
Present back to the client, and any stakeholders, in a face to face meeting
Present to your team at the kick-off meeting
Include them at the top of all project documentation e.g. sitemaps, functional specifications and creative briefs
Re-iterate them verbally at the start of any new project phase e.g. site IA, development and design
Remind everyone of the KPIs when reviewing any revisions of work and citing them as reasons for your feedback and suggestions
Defining realistic and measurable web project KPIs, and keeping them at the forefront of everyone’s mind throughout a project, is not only one of the most crucial parts of a web project manager’s role, but also takes comparatively less effort than most other project tasks you will perform for what is a huge benefit to all. It keeps everyone focussed on why the project exists in the first place, acts a guide to all decision making from beginning to end and serves as a project success indicator that benefits both client and web agency.

But sales aside, KPIs are good for web agencies because they ensure all teams remain focussed on the business problems that need solving as opposed to the latest techniques or technologies. Yes a web agency must keep up to date with all of the latest trends to remain competitive, but cultivating an entire team to become primarily business focussed is by far more valuable to an agency in the long-run than any use of cutting edge technologies as that team will consistently be delivering business value to clients and this only ever increases agency team morale.

KPIs can also serve as a boundary to client requests for features that are out of scope. In this instance, with KPIs defined, a web project manager can, with all sincerity, ask which KPI this relates too. More often than not, the answer will be none and in one swift move you have not only protected the project’s scope but kept the client focussed on their business’s primary aims and saved them money.




PROJECT MANAGEMENT IS FOR CORPORATES!
You have all no doubt read countless articles on how best to plan a web project. They all go into varying amounts of detail about the steps you should take and how if you don’t follow them the whole world will fall from underneath your feet. I happen to agree with this general philosophy and can often be found preaching the same in my day job.

However, the trouble with many of these articles is they’re often written by authors who work for a large corporate and are planning a multi-million pound enterprise web projects that must use the PRINCE2 methodology and assumes you have weeks of time allocated to plan your project.

For those of us working in small web agencies, or as super funky freelancers, the reality of the web project planning process is a little different…

In this three part article I hope to fill this gap a little with my humble ramblings on pragmatic web project management, addressing why it is often skipped, what the advantages are, the two different type of planning personalities that exist and a little insight into the processes and tools I use to help me retain what sanity I have left.

WHY PLAN AT ALL?
Before talking about why it’s often skipped or how to plan, it’s important to discuss why planning is needed at all for web projects. Simply put, planning a web project allows you to:

Define and manage the project scope
Identify and minimise risks to the project
Break the allocated project time into manageable phases and tasks
Determine realistic milestones and client-side deadlines
Track progress and control the project
Secure the necessary resource
Although these points sound very much like the corporate web project management waffle I mention in the opening part of this article, they apply to web projects of all shapes and sizes. Not being able to satisfy these points at all stages of any sized project can often spell disaster.

WHY WEB PROJECT PLANNING IS OFTEN SKIPPED
It sounds obvious on paper that planning is a necessary and valuable stage of any web project, but the reality of day to day web project management in a small business, or as a freelancer, often makes it difficult to remain disciplined enough to ensure thorough planning is always conducted.

There are many reasons why planning a website project in a small agency, or as a freelancer, is quite different, they include the usual suspects:

Lack of time
Lack of web project planning skills
Lack of resource available to plan
Lack of budget
The belief planning over complicates
Web project planning is not fun
LACK OF TIME
It takes time to plan a web project, there’s no getting around it. When feeling the time and cash flow pressures, an agency or freelancer does on a daily basis, it can often feel like stalling design and development work in order to plan is just slowing things down too much, adding unnecessary time and cost to the budgets, stopping the project being completed and that essential last 50% payment coming in hitting your bank. The only real questions to ask are: Does it actually slow the project delivery down and add to the budget?

The default answers to these questions are:

“Don’t be silly, of course it doesn’t slow delivery down or add budget, it speeds it up and saves you and the client a load of cash.”

However, at the risk of undermining my own article, I’m going to say it depends… It really does depend on the web project, the web project manager, the web team and the client. In my experience planning has no negative effects but to say you will never bring a project in on budget and on time without planning is a falsehood and I discuss this in the Part 2 of this article (coming soon).

LACK OF WEB PROJECT PLANNING SKILLS
Project planning is not as easy as it looks, I personally didn’t realise this until I had to do it, and despite planning many projects still don’t feel I’m a Jedi-level web project planner. Sure I’d read some books and a whole heap of articles and tutorials, but the reality is like anything, you learn on the job and from your mistakes. Likewise, as with anything else, experience is the most valuable commodity with refining any skill.

The truth is many small agencies and freelancers do not yet possess the skills to confidently plan a web project in its entirety. While I can only implore both to start learning, I do however feel this reason is often used as an excuse to dismiss web project planning as a “waste of time” (I really have heard this said with my own, rather large, ears. I swear I almost fainted).

But I can empathise with this attitude… let’s use an obvious analogy to explain – homemade curry.

I like a curry as much as the next person, I also like to cook. I’m told making a curry from scratch is ten times better than a takeaway or using a bottled sauce. Every part of me knows this must be true and yet I don’t make one from scratch myself, why? Because it’s just not worth it… the bottled sauce is fine and tastes good – at least that’s what I tell myself and others. The truth is, to me, making a curry from scratch requires a lot of fiddling takes ages and looks really complex regardless of the rewards of a homemade one.

To the uninitiated used to not planning web projects, yet happily making a living, it can seem a little daunting to contemplate starting to plan using any processes given the stigma processes carry of being slow. Like with my curry, any new skill being used for the first few times will add a significant amount of time to the process you’re used to, you will make mistakes, perhaps a few horrific ones, but once you’ve mastered it, you’ll be quick, you’ll reap the rewards, see the benefits and wonder why you ever had such a problem with it.

Damn, now I actually want a curry.

LACK OF RESOURCE AVAILABLE TO PLAN
As I said before, planning takes time and that is something few of us can say we have in abundance. Even dedicated web project managers are all too often stacked with too many projects and too little time to plan effectively.

The only advice I can offer here is to try and shut yourself away from the world for a day or two, resist the temptation to deal with e-mail and phone calls, and plan that project. This is easier said than done, but I always try to remind myself that it’s quite possible I could’ve been ill for those two days and if I had been would have probably not moved any projects forward, dealt with e-mail or taken phone calls – what’s the difference?

LACK OF BUDGET
This is often a contentious issue because a salesman will not want to add a row in their project estimate to the client that ups their final quote price for something that isn’t a production task – however this really isn’t necessary. If you charge for web project management time, and have been a good boy or girl and been tracking project management time from previous projects in order to identify trends like web project management tends to take between 10% -20% of the total project time, you should always be able to allocate an adequate amount of time to a project timescale or estimate in order to cater for the time required to manage the project, including the planning phase.

Sorry folks, lack of project budget is just not a justifiable reason for not planning your project. If you have to, do it for free, you will undoubtedly recoup any time spent on fewer design and functionality revisions in the long-run due to the planning you did.

THE BELIEF PLANNING OVER COMPLICATES
Although you will often hear this line from the ‘dive in and get started’ planning personality mentioned in Part 2 of this article, and despite it not being a popular answer amongst the web project managers out there, the truth is they can sometimes be right.

When you’re up against the clock and the pressure is on in a small agency or freelance role, and instead choose to update your GANTT chart each time a task is delayed by 3 hours, or insist on wireframing the 404 error page, chances are you are focussing too much on the planning when you should be focussing on the doing.

That said, you also have to know when to stop to update your schedule or perform the most crucial web project management tasks so that you can maintain a level of control over your project. Not planning when you know you should is a dangerous habit to get into and trust me, before you know you have several projects all going tits up and in ten different directions and all because you chose to do when you should have planned.

Being a good web project manager in a busy small business environment means you have to be wise and flexible enough to know when to plan and when to just get on and ‘do’!

WEB PROJECT PLANNING IS NOT FUN
This heading is slightly misleading, I enjoy web project planning for two reasons:

It’s just what I happen to enjoy doing these days
It feels like a lovely warm fuzzy blanket at the beginning of a project to know you have identified the risks, broken down the project and can visualise every step, including the end
As with so many of the most critical parts of web project management, like producing detailed estimates, to most it’s just not exciting or sexy and there is only one cure – try planning your next few web projects that warrant planning before starting production and see if it seems to help or hinder.

If you do it right, remain disciplined and consistent I would wager ownership of my cat Spiderpig that you won’t look back – if I’m wrong I will personally cook you a curry from scratch…

WHY SMALL WEB AGENCIES AND FREELANCERS SHOULD PLAN THOROUGHLY
Major reasons small web agencies and freelancers should get into the habit of planning web projects thoroughly is so they can begin to develop some repeatable processes that they can rely on for every project, or even apply the skills and techniques to parts of their projects if full planning is just not possible.

If anything, I believe web project planning, in some respects, is more important to a small agency or freelancer because there is less room for mistakes given most are in a constant state of survival mode. Yes a corporate web project needs planning, but a mistake is less likely to put them out of business! In our world, and as I’ve said in previous articles, one or two whoppers of mistakes can mean the end of a business…

Melodrama aside, I believe it’s time for small web agencies and freelancers to up their game on the web project management side of things.

We are maturing as an industry at a rapid rate and I believe the days of fumbling our way through projects in our small offices or bedrooms are coming to an end.

We live in an age where clients are becoming more web savvy and quick to spot a disorganised supplier, and where they are more likely to hire, or work with again with, an agency or freelancer who can demonstrate a certain level of professionalism, competence and consistency when it comes to planning and running their projects.

In Part 2 of this article I will describe the two types of people that plan/manage web projects and the advantages and disadvantages of both, and in Part 3 I will go into more detail about the techniques and tools I use when planning web projects… stay tuned.

PLANNING PERSONALITIES
I often come across both web agencies and freelancers who consistently do not plan their web projects, and no matter how many times the same mistakes are made, they continue to push ahead using the same techniques. Once upon a time I put this down to sheer naivety, but I’ve come to realise it’s not naivety at all, it’s just that people responsible for running web projects and web project management are very different (not sure it should have taken me so long to realise this!)

A really good, if somewhat angry, article, posted by Karine, entitled “Project management and fire fighting” on Ace Project helped inspire this part of the article in the series. It summarises the two different types of web project planning personalities I talk about here; Fire Fighters and Forest Rangers.

FIRE FIGHTERS AND FOREST RANGERS
To further back up Karine’s summary I also heard a quote the other day that I found fascinating, it stated you get two types of people when it comes to planning:

Someone who doesn’t enjoy planning and just dives straight into production. These people will get started quickly and will reach the finishing line after solving many challenges as and when they arise in an ad hoc fashion (The Fire Fighter)
Someone who will start slowly, meticulously planning every step from start to finish and although will gain momentum more slowly, will usually complete the task correctly first time round (The Forest Ranger)
The extreme sportsman and the robot; the two web project planning personalities.Two planning personalities; Fire Fighters & Forest Rangers
(Ok, I realise these images show neither a Fire Fighter or Forest Ranger, but you get the meaning behind them no?)

THE TWO WEB PROJECT PLANNING PERSONALITIES
This planning personality quote fascinated me so much because my initial reaction was that the person who just dives in is clearly a little mental if they think they can successfully bring a project in on time, on budget and to a high quality by taking this approach.

But soon after hearing this quote it dawned on me that, web project management ideals aside, and speaking from the reality of running web projects in a small web agency or as a freelancer, I’ve seen it done, and not just once but on several projects at several companies.

So what does this mean? That you can plan and run web projects using either approach? Using quotes from Karine’s article, let’s take a closer look at the reasons why both web project management personalities/approaches are adopted when put in context of the frantic pace and environment we all work in today…

THE FIRE FIGHTER
Fire fighting is a management style not only used by project managers. When someone spends all their time putting out fires, they look very busy, and they have a great sense of purpose.

Although this summary has some truth, I do feel perhaps the article was perhaps written on the back of a bad experience! I say this because although I have met many Fire Fighters, I don’t believe they run web projects in this way in order to look busy or have a sense of purpose.

I believe the reasons some web project managers adopt the fire fighting approach are because they:

Have no time to plan or run a web project due to all sorts of everyday pressures such as cash flow or a large client with un-realistic and inflexible deadlines
Are suffering from web project overload – responsible for too many projects at a given time
Have a lack of web project management/planning skills and experience and don’t know any other way
Enjoy the adrenaline buzz of the unknown during projects
Don’t enjoy web project planning
Just want to get on with the production
Have had successes with the approach before
THE FOREST RANGER
While fire fighters are very visible and have a high-risk, dangerous job, forest rangers are just as important: they keep fires from starting in the first place. It’s not as glamorous as fire fighting, but it causes less damage.

I find this quote to also be mostly true, but would emphasise that I believe Forest Rangers have an equally high-risk and dangerous job given they are ultimately just as responsible for web projects as Fire Fighters.

The reasons for taking the Forest Ranger approach are mostly the exact opposite of the reasons for adopting the Fire Fighting role. A Forest Ranger will typically:

Have allocated time per project to plan web projects in detail
Be responsible for an acceptable amount of web projects at any one time thus not falling victim to project overload
Come armed with web project planning skills and experience
Have a strong dislike of project fires and emergencies and a love of predicting and avoiding them in advance
Enjoy web project planning
Believe beginning web project production work before planning is a large risk
Have had successes with the approach before
SO WHAT’S THE BEST PERSONALITY FOR WEB PROJECT PLANNING?
Well first of all it should be said that although I have discussed two different web project planning personality types, it doesn’t necessarily mean one person can only adopt one personality throughout the many projects they plan.

As a web project manager in a small agency, or as a freelancer, working to tight deadlines and on too many projects at once will inevitably lead to you at some stage having to skip the detailed planning phase. You know it’s wrong, you know it is bound to cause problems and lost time and money down the road but the reality is the project must start now! Other times you will be lucky enough, or choose to spend an evening or weekend, to have the time to plan a project in detail.

So what happens when you have to be, or are by default, a Fire Fighter? Why do those projects sometimes go well?

WHY FIRE FIGHTING SOMETIMES WORKS
As I mentioned previously, despite going against all I know to be good and true on this earth, occasionally I will see a Fire Fighter bring a project in on time and on budget and I always ask myself, how? From what I’ve seen the answer is more often by luck, with a hint of experience of running projects this way.

If you get the right project, with the right budget, right team, a good client and have many years experience of diving in and just starting on design or development, you could very well bring that project home with a gold star – it happens.

However, if even one of those variables isn’t present, you could really get caught out the minute something goes wrong and cause yourself and your team a whole load of stress… this is when the methodical and thorough planning of a Forest Ranger really proves valuable.

CONSISTENCY IS KEY
Although Fire Fighters can bring some projects in on time and on budget, others will spiral horribly out of control, and when it does, reeling it back in to a controlled state can be a nightmare because usually there has been little documentation, ambiguous or non-existent scope definition and unclear phase sign-offs.

Being a Forest Ranger by no means guarantees project success, but over time it tends to prove more stress free and consistent because many of the problems encountered along the way, and there will always be several, can be addressed quickly, comprehensively and with complete confidence.

If a Fire Fighter’s project is going over budget or running late and there has been no defined scope sign-off or project schedule, the client is well within their rights to question why and become rather unpleasant. If the same thing begins to happen in a Forest Ranger’s project, he or she, can point to how, who, what, why and when with absolute conviction – in most cases, with the full facts presented to them, a client will generally accept the situation and either compromise or provide additional funding.

Over time, a Forest Ranger’s consistent form of web project planning and management will produce consistent results when compared to that of a Fire Fighter.

There’s no way to completely guarantee success on a project. There are always issues that arise and sometimes even the tightest control and the best communication, management and resources can’t ensure success. But the probability of success is exponentially higher with well-documented and utilized Project Management processes in place.

THE PLANNING PERSONALITY HIERARCHAL TRUTH
Perhaps some Fire Fighters out there are reading this article and thinking “Oh be quiet thesambarnes you little midget, I don’t bother with the kind of planning you mention and I’m still in business!”

To this I say well done, you’ve been very lucky and long may you prosper, but I would offer the following response to you as the final piece of evidence that the Fire Fighting approach is always the second choice and thus by definition the most vulnerable…

I can absolutely guarantee each and every person that considers themselves a Forest Ranger at heart, and works in a small web agency or as a freelancer, has adopted the Fire Fighter approach on several projects during their career.

What’s interesting about this is I think the number of Fire Fighters who could honestly say they’ve adopted, and stuck to for a whole project, the Forest Ranger approach for even one project is significantly smaller – thus the following hierarchy is formed with regards to web project planning and management:

If you have the skills, experience and time to implement, the most effective, efficient and solid web project management approach is that of the Forest Ranger
If you do not have the skills, experience or time available to implement the Forest Ranger approach, the fall back is to adopt the Fire Fighter role and just get the job done as best you can
I would be open to hear any challenges on this, and change my opinion accordingly, but without a convincing challenge I think this role reversal comparison, and truth that Fire Fighting, although occasionally successful, happens when a crucial skill or variable is lacking from a web project manger’s toolkit, ultimately places the two approaches in a hierarchal order rather than on a level footing.

EXAMPLE SMALL WEBSITE BRIEF
Let’s take the following common brief to a small agency or freelancer as our example scenario.

“Hey web nerdy geek person, I own a one man band catering business. I want a small website so people can find me, view my menus and book my services online. I want to be able to update the website content myself, edit my menus, upload images to the menu gallery and receive orders via e-mail. I’d like to launch in 4 weeks and have a £3000 budget.”

Notice I omitted the requirement to be number one on Google for the keyword “food”. This would clearly cost at least another £1000.

PLANNING? PAH, NO NEED, NO TIME – BORING!
Ah (I hear you say), a small simple website, could probably get started on designing the homepage straight away, let’s get it on!!!

The truth is, yes, you could dive straight into your sketchbook or Photoshop and get designing, but what will go on the homepage exactly? At this point you could guess based on, what is usually, a slightly woolly set of initial meeting notes. But the reality is you just don’t know and the chances are you will spend time on several revisions of the homepage and it’s widgets until you get the client’s approval.

If you get it right first time then you got lucky or you’re a psychic web designer (If psychic please contact me for immediate employment opportunity).

By diving in and getting the homepage approved by the client you will have used a certain amount of project time, but how much did you have allocated for the homepage design and what date should it have been signed off by in order to remain on track for launch?

If you don’t know the exact answers to these questions your project is already out of control.

Despite this, you press on and get approval for all design, hooray! You begin to start the functional phase of the project only to discover the client wants a rotating banner on the homepage and wants to be able to do a whole host of other things dynamically that when designing you had envisaged being static elements – oh the pain of re-opening the design phase of the project after ‘approval’.

But, what about if you choose to hold off from the production side of things and start with some project planning…

PRAGMATIC WEB PROJECT PLANNING
Ok, so the above scenario is a little exaggerated to illustrate the point, but I challenge anyone, and I include myself, to deny they’ve ever found themselves in a similar situation with a web project, I know I have and no doubt will again!

The web project planning processes described below are not intended to the be a definitive set of web project management techniques that align with the classic project management methodologies, but a stripped down version that I personally find practical on a day to day basis when trying to juggle the realistic amount of work and lack of time we all have.

For the freelancer this may seem all a bit too much to consider doing, but I can assure you, once you get to grips with it you can knock out all of the processes in a solid day or two for projects ranging from small to medium and it will inevitably save you a lot more days in the long run!

DEFINING SCOPE, IDENTIFYING RISKS AND GRANULAR PROJECT TASKS
If you estimated the web project using a method similar to the one I described in my Estimating Time for Web Projects more accurately series you already have a head start as you have a complete breakdown of all the design and functional requirements, along with timescales. If not, don’t panic, you can retro fit the method based on the budget and deadline as follows:

Speak at length with the client and break the project down into all design and functional requirements, getting as granular as possible for both
Document any assumptions you have to make about the project due to lack of information e.g. the client will perform all content entry and provide all images
Estimate times for all tasks and see how the totals match with the budget and deadline.
If your estimates put you over on both, begin to work with the client to agree on dropping or simplifying design and features until you are both happy
Enter the agreed tasks and times into your time tracking tool
By going through this initial exercise with the client you have immediately gained a great deal of control over your project before you’ve even thought about starting that all important homepage design by:

Defining the project scope, at a high-level, allowing you to manage any scope creep throughout by being able to identify any feature requests as ‘new’ by it not being present in the task list
Identified some of the project risks in terms of features that are complex
Broken the project down into granular tasks, knowing how long you have to complete each one
Now you have all of this defined information you can continue with the web project planning process, starting with the project schedule.

PRODUCING A PROJECT SCHEDULE
Using the agreed estimated times and deadline you can now produce a project schedule. Using a simple, free and open-source tool like Planner; define your web project start date, enter all of the project tasks you have identified, with the exact amount of time allowed for each. PM tools like Planner will automatically assign each task with a start and end date.

Screenshot of Planner - a great free and open-source project management tool.Planner: Create a project schedule & even export as HTML
One of the advantages of using a tool that allows you to produce a GANTT chart, with start and end dates for phases and tasks, is that you can add:

Client tasks
Revision time
Dependencies
Lag
Resource allocation
Project milestones
Dependencies? Lag? Ewww, web project management waffle! But even if you don’t plan your web projects thoroughly you will need to deal with all the above during the project – being prepared for these in advance is the magic!

CLIENT TASKS AND REVISION TIME
One thing your granular project breakdown will often not include, because it’s not something you need to estimate on in order to produce a quote, is the tasks the client must complete throughout the project and the revision mini-stages you have to expect to go through before sign-off of any phase or task. At this stage you need to include them, not only for your sake but also the clients’.

This means adding tasks such as:

Client homepage design review
Homepage design revisions
Client homepage design sign-off
Client copywriting
Despite these tasks being either encapsulated in your quote as ‘Homepage design’, or not at all (client copywriting), when producing a project schedule it is crucial to consider them all as they impact the overall project timeline. For example, if you have determined you only have 3 days to complete the homepage design phase, by adding in review and revision times you can communicate to the client that, in order to hit the deadline and keep the project on schedule, they must be available to review, provide feedback, sign-off and deliver website copy on/by certain dates.

Often a client seeing the turnaround time required from them, when comparing with their busy schedule, can illustrate the realism of hitting their go-live date and open up an adult dialogue that will see an extension allowed.

Note that this is still before you have put pen to paper and started a sitemap or designing the homepage – this is hardcore client expectation setting right at the beginning of the project and in the right way, as opposed to 2 weeks before go live when print campaigns have been booked!

DEPENDENCIES
Dependencies are simply rules that state Phase / Task A cannot begin until Phase / Task B is complete. Typical examples being:

Sub-page design task cannot start until the homepage design task has been completed
Back-end development phase cannot begin until the Solution Design phase has been signed off by the client
Dependencies are a great way to adjust project schedules and set client expectation when the inevitable delays happen because, taking the functional specification / back-end development example, if a delay occurred either yours or the client’s side and the functional specification overran, you could update the expected end date and the tasks / phases that are dependent on the specification being signed off will automatically shift along the calendar thus producing new milestone and go-live dates.

Of course, shifting milestone and go-live dates is never ideal, but if you can consistently explain to a client why the dates have moved, or at least communicate, when delivering the project schedule, that if you don’t get sign-off or receive content by this date, then the dependent tasks will be shifted to later dates, they will generally be more receptive to any changed timelines.

LAG
Lag is the term associated with the amount of time expected between tasks. For example, although you may have an allocated time of 8 hours for the homepage design, it is unrealistic to schedule in 8 hours or 1 day for this task. Instead you would schedule:

3.5 hours for a first version that you send to the client
A lag of perhaps 1 day that the client will need in order to review and submit feedback
2 hours revision time before re-sending to the client for review
Another 1 day of lag to allow the client time to provide feedback
The remaining 2.5 hours for final amends before sending for sign-off, and finally
1 day to allow for the client final review and actually getting around to formally signing off the design
As you can see, this 8 hour task could actually take up to 6 days to complete. It still surprises me how often I see an 8 hour task scheduled in for 1 or even 2 days and the constant shock when it actually takes a week or longer.

Then again, although I may have developed an aptitude for this lesson, I still regularly find myself in the McDonalds drive through and then gasp in disbelief as my jelly belly expands…

RESOURCE ALLOCATION
This is a huge topic in its own right. GANTT chart tools allow you to assign each project task to a team member. However, this being an article about pragmatic web project management in a small web agency or as a freelancer I will not go much further on this topic. I find simply assigning tasks to the appropriate internal team and client an adequate solution. It tells me what resource I need and when, and also rubber stamps the client’s initials against any tasks they need to complete e.g. reviews, providing content and sign-off.

MILESTONES
Milestones can be assigned to any project phase, but are generally used to define the beginning or end of a high-level project phase e.g. Design complete, Back-end development begins etc. These are the big dates to watch out for as hitting them all means you’re on track to complete the project on time.

Creating a GANNT chart that breaks down the project into as much detail as possible, adding time estimates, dependencies and lag, results in clear start and end dates for each task and phase, and ultimately produces definitive dates for the project milestones.

WHY GANTT CHARTS WORK FOR ME
GANTT charts are the subject of much debate in the project management world, some people love them and some hate them. You will find endless conversations online arguing how they are old fashioned and enforce a Waterfall methodology.

I am by no means saying they are the ultimate solution and you should never move away from them, all I am saying here is that at this moment in time they work for me on the kinds of projects I work on currently.

They allow me to:

Explain the web project lifecycle to the client
Schedule a realistic timeline with milestones that are visible to everyone
Communicate to the client their level of involvement and when they need to be available
Track the project’s progress at a low-level
Quickly adjust the project schedule and produce new milestone dates if anything overruns
Highlight the fact I need to secure more resource in order to meet the original dates
Need I sell it more? This stuff sells itself…

THE REWARDS OF WEB PROJECT PLANNING
So you’ve gone through this, sometimes painfully slow and methodical, web project planning process – how does it help you?

Cast your mind back to the advantages of planning defined in Part 1 of this article and see how this approach has satisfied each point:

Define and manage the project scope
Completed and possible through granular project breakdown
Identify and minimise risks to the project
Completed through granular project breakdown, assumption listing and scheduling
Break the allocated project time into manageable phases and tasks
Completed through granular project breakdown
Determine realistic milestones and client-side deadlines
Completed through project scheduling
Track progress and control the project
Possible with an easily updatable project schedule and consistent time tracking tasks
Secure the necessary resource
Easy to identify using an easily updateable schedule
Being able to manage these fundamental web project management factors greatly increases your chances of delivering on budget and on time without having to compromise on quality which equals happy you and happy client!

IN SUMMARY
When working in a busy environment, as either a web agency team member or as a freelancer, where delivery is what gets you paid, justifying a non-production / non-billable day or two to plan the project is pretty hard to do. Some people know it should be done and just can’t carve out the time, others don’t really believe planning in that much detail is necessary.

Those that can’t find the time should probably try to track the time they spend during their projects working on tasks that they wouldn’t have to if they had planned first – usually this time is much greater than the time it would’ve taken to plan.

Those that don’t believe planning in detail is necessary have probably had a few successes where a project was bought in on time and on budget without a planning stage, or are just avoiding admitting the fact that they don’t enjoy planning. Admitting you don’t enjoy planning is fine, not everyone does, but while admitting this, please try to also admit how many projects have not been delivered on time or budget that perhaps could’ve been if only you’d planned thoroughly.

Always skipping web project planning is a hit and miss affair where success is more dependent on the project and client rather than your ability as a web project manager.

Consistent and thorough web project planning generally results in a more consistent success rate with web projects because, before production begins, you are able to identify, define, and thus manage the critical parts of any project; phases, tasks, resource, timelines, milestones and risks and communicate these to the client.

Thorough web project planning does not ensure a project will come in on time or on budget, but it does increase the chances, and if over budget and late, it will also limit the extent the project overruns because while you may have missed or underestimated a few tasks or risks at the planning stage, you will have identified many more that you have managed to successfully control – and anything you missed this time, you can easily make sure you don’t the next time.

To the web project managers out there, some of the advantages and methods described in this article will be nothing new, but, to web agency and freelance guys and girls with little web project management and planning experience, I hope it explains why planning web projects is so important, to both supplier and client.

But primarily I hope it shows that planning a web project is not a dark art that should only be tackled by dedicated web project managers, it’s something anyone can do as long as you can mentally envisage the project from start to finish…

The real dark art is actually being able to determine the appropriate level of planning that should be undertaken for each project and then managing the project to that plan once in full swing!

So, I open up the floor to you guys…

### Time

A GOOD FOUNDATION
After reading Alyssa Gregory’s recent article on Sitepoint.com, How to Estimate Time for a Project, I couldn’t help but feel that it was a good introduction but lacked a little when compared with the realities and complexities of estimating/quoting for a website or web application.

But before we look at how to create more accurate estimates for web projects, it’s important to look at the reasons why this area is such a difficult one and why web project management forums aren’t exactly littered with posts entitled “How can I stop completing web projects on budget?”

WHY UNDERESTIMATING IS SO COMMON
There are many common reasons why web projects are often underestimated by freelancers and web agencies alike, they include the following:

The technologies required have never been used before
Large parts of the project are grey areas at the time of estimating
The features needed are very specific to the client’s industry and thus bespoke
To break the project down into the detail it would require almost as much as work as the paid for requirements gathering phase
While almost all web folk will admit to these points being common reasons why it’s difficult to estimate time for web projects, there are a few that will admit to the following that are just as true:

No previous project ‘estimated vs. actual’ analysis has been conducted to draw on
The client needs an estimate for their large project tomorrow
The revenue needs for immediate cash flow now outweigh the effects of no new business now
Estimating time for a project is not fun
I am no different. At one point or the other I have cited the valid public reasons but also fallen foul of the not so public ones; this is the reality of working as an insanely busy freelancer, or in an equally busy web agency, just trying to keep your head above the water financially.

However, there are few worse feelings in this industry than getting to any point in a project and realising you’ve grossly underestimated the time, it’s a bitter taste you don’t forget in a hurry and should strive to avoid again.

So why does it happen time and time again?

THE DAY-TO-DAY REALITY
The approaches to creating more accurate estimates for web projects that I will describe in Part 2 of this article explain how to combat several of the common reasons for underestimating. I personally use them to track time on all projects and use the data gathered when estimating new ones – the results are very positive indeed.

However, as you can see below, it doesn’t resolve them all:

The technologies required have never been used before
Large parts of the project are grey areas at the time of estimating
The features needed are very specific to the client’s industry and thus bespoke
To break the project down into the detail it would require almost as much as work as the paid for requirements gathering phase
No previous project ‘estimated vs. actual’ analysis has been conducted to draw on
The client needs an estimate for their large project tomorrow
The revenue needs for immediate cash flow now outweigh the effects of no new business now
Estimating time for a project is not fun
So what can you do to combat each of these realities?

TECHNOLOGIES HAVE NEVER BEEN USED BEFORE
If you are estimating time needed to implement a solution using a technology you have little or no experience of, you will have to conduct some basic research and then just guess! Alternatively, try to negotiate a smaller fee with which you can conduct the first stages of the project in terms of research and putting together some kind of high-level specification for the project.

At best, you learn a new technology, build a rapport with the client and win the remaining work. At worst, you’ve learnt a new technology, you’ve generated revenue and the client has a good specification to update its project tender with.

DETAILED ESTIMATION EXERCISES TAKE TOO LONG
My personal approach takes time, much more than the traditional method of providing an estimate purely based on both experience and instinct. What if you spend hours or days putting together this detailed quote, breaking the project down perfectly, and then don’t win the work. Is that a loss of opportunity on another potential sale? Does the client now have a free detailed breakdown for free?

Well yes, but this is just how it goes in any sales situation. Is it wasted work? Possibly, but it’s also possible you have researched a new technology or broken down a feature you haven’t used before. What’s to stop you trying to sell this to existing or new clients if it aligns with their long-term business aims?

CLIENT NEEDS ESTIMATE FOR LARGE PROJECT TOMORROW
If a client needs an estimate for a large project tomorrow, please refer to the ball park figure section in Part 2 of this article. Try to confirm a ball park figure and then assess the potential gains to your business versus the possibility of underestimating this one project. Always bear in mind, the larger the project, the greater the likelihood you will underestimate and the potential loss you could incur by submitting a low estimate.

BUSINESS REVENUE NEEDS
Revenue needs of a freelancer or small businesses for cash flow is an ever present issue. A typical dilemma faced is:

We need £20k in revenue this month to sustain the business
Client is offering us a maximum of £10k now and we don’t have many other leads
We feel their project will cost a minimum of £15k
We can walk away now and not lose £7k, but also not make £10k
We can take the project on and try and do it for £10k
We can take the project on; accept the £5k loss, break even and live to fight another day
This quandary is the reality of running a business and just one of the daily tough decisions a freelancer or Managing Director has to make, I don’t envy them. What to do in this situation is entirely the business owners decision, all you can do is get accurate information to them so that they can make as informed a decision as possible.

ESTIMATING TIME FOR A PROJECT IS NOT FUN
Well never has a truer word been spoken. Despite taking so much pride in it, and also testing new ways to improve accuracy, it’s not often a person will love the process of compiling and delivering a project estimate (if you find one, grab hold of them and lock them in your office!).

Let us speak plainly my friends; the following facts are true when it comes to estimating web projects:

It’s hard work and takes you outside your comfort zone
Forces you to predict the future
Usually has to be completed alongside your plans for your already fully booked week
Makes you largely responsible for the:
Sales success
Solution offered
Eventual profitability of the project
Growth/survival of your business
With all of the above being truisms that I believe most people who have to estimate web project feel, the scary truth of the matter is getting it wrong just a few times can leave a freelancer or small web agency in real turmoil.

IDENTIFY THEN FIX
For all of the reasons stated above, getting people who are primarily from a creative or technical background and more passionate in actually creating something, to really spend time on developing a solid and reliable web project time estimating process is quite difficult and understandably so, it’s just not sexy work.

But, especially in these turbulent times, being able to identify any gaps in your entire web project management workflow that (incoming buzzword bingo phrases) minimise project risk and maximise project profit should take a front seat, and the web project estimation phase is the most crucial in achieving these aims.

In Part 2 of this article I will go into detail of how I personally go about estimating time for web projects, both on an individual project and long-term multiple project basis, that combats the remaining common reasons for underestimating.

ESTIMATING PROJECTS AND THE OCCULT
After reading Alyssa Gregory’s recent article on Sitepoint.com, How to Estimate Time for a Project, I couldn’t help but feel that it was a good introduction but lacked a little when compared with the realities and complexities of estimating/quoting for a website or web application.

The Devil is in the detail: When people say that the devil is in the detail, they mean that small things in plans and schemes that are often overlooked can cause serious problems later on.
Using English.com

I may not believe in the Devil, but I do believe this statement to be as true as it gets when it comes to estimating time for web projects.

ESTIMATING WEB PROJECTS ACCURATELY
Some would say this is an oxymoron, and to some extent I would agree, but I do believe by applying a few techniques it’s possible to drastically increase the accuracy of most web project estimates and avoid the feeling of wanting to curl up in the foetal position and whimper helplessly under your duvet.

CONFIRM A BALL PARK FIGURE
Before you embark on any detailed estimate exercise it’s crucial to immediately confirm with the client a rough budget, or budget range, they feel would be acceptable for an estimate. After all, if you get a new business lead, spend three days estimating and deliver a proposal worth £30,000 only to hear that the client ‘appreciates your response’ but only has £3000 to spend, you probably deserve to be struck with reasonable force in the baby-making department.

When you receive a project brief, throw some figures out there for the client to comment on, only one of a possible few things will happen:

They will laugh and hang up when they hear your daily rate
You will laugh and hang up when you hear they want Facebook for £4000
They will say you’re in the right area but probably need to come down or go up a little bit
They will refuse to feedback and say “We are open to suggestions”
For these possibilities what the next steps are need little explanation, but the “we are open to suggestions” answer is always the trickiest. In these cases it really is down to you to make a decision if the project is worth the risk of spending time writing a proposal and estimating for. It could be that the potential for new work is huge, or the client is extremely high profile and thus often it’s worth it, however, if you feel none of these are true, you should probably ask yourself what this statement says about the client and if you want to work with them.

It’s understandable a client wants to get their website or web application at the lowest cost, but the best clients are the most professional, experienced and ethical ones and simply know that not providing a rough budget range could waste theirs and your time.

Assuming you have made the decision to pursue the lead, you can now begin the detailed estimating exercise.

CONSISTENT PROJECT PHASE BREAKDOWNS
Most web projects can be broken down into the following high-level categories:

Research and planning
Solution design
Functional specification
Web design
Front-end development
Back-end development
Content entry
Each individual project will contain unique tasks, but most can be encapsulated in the above phases.

The first step to increasing accuracy of web project estimates is to make sure you always begin with a consistent set of categories and then add as many sub-categories and tasks as you like.

GET GRANULAR, THEN GET MORE GRANULAR
Now your consistent high-level project phases are defined, it’s time to get granular and add sub-phases and tasks e.g.:

Research and planning
Requirements gathering
Project planning
Solution design
Sitemap
Wireframes
User workflows
Functional specification
Design
Initial homepage look and feel
Content page
Master content page template
News main page
News item
Front-end development
Template x5 XHTML/CSS
Cross-browser fixes
Back-end development
CMS Setup and configuration
News feature
Contact us form
Content entry
This full list of required project tasks can be created based on the pre-sales research you have conducted with the client. It is imperative to nail down, in as much detail as possible, what exactly the client wants before you submit an estimate or begin work.

The more granular you can get, the more you are forced at this early stage to think through each part of the project, literally designing and building the website or application from beginning to end in your head.

By going through the project step-by-step, putting yourself in the shoes of the information architect, the designer and all developers, will often immediately result in many issues rearing their head that you need to clarify before putting in an estimate, take the News feature for example. Ideally you could break each feature down as much as you can, so the News feature may actually end up looking like the following:

News feature
Add/edit/delete new item
Upload image
Attach PDF
Auto-archiving
RSS
By resisting the temptation to just think “News… ummm… 5 hours” and breaking it down to this level means you’re mentally building the feature step-by-step and raising questions as you go.

So the client needs to be able to upload images to their news items, ok, but do they need:

Auto-resize capability?
Auto-thumbnail generation?
Full-screen viewing?
Caption addition facility?
I’m sure you can think of many more questions that could be associated with a simple upload image for a news item requirement. This demonstrates the possible scope variations that are contained within even the smallest of features and that could impact your estimates / risk of underestimating.

By getting granular and mentally trying to build the solution you are able to identify and address these issues early on, making sure to cater for them in your final estimate.

A Web Project Manager knows how to design and develop most of the project on his own, even if with poorer results compared to his team. This allows him to estimate projects with good approximation and to understand his team’s problems and difficulties
Introduction to Web Project Management: Fucina Web

GRANULARITY: GOOD FOR THE CLIENT AND GOOD FOR YOU
Don’t forget, by getting this granular not only increases your estimations accuracy, but it also gives you the instant ability to remove proposed features quickly if your estimate exceeds the client’s maximum budget! Need to shave 10 hours off the budget? Well, rather than removing the News feature entirely, how about remove the thumbnail and caption adding functionality from News, and a few other small niceties from other features and still allow the client to have the basic versions of all the features they need? Simply remove the lines and hey presto, a new estimate at warp speed and with full visibility to the client of what functionality they’re sacrificing for budget.

Roughly guessing the News feature will take 5 hours is one thing, but what about when the client comes to you after seeing the initial functional specification and asks where the archive section is or how they attach PDFs simply because they assumed the News section they would be getting is like the News section on another website they’d seen?

Getting granular will not always allow you to breakout a required feature in full because it is client industry specific. If you are ever in any doubts about what the client needs, ASK THEM! Take the time to understand their business so that you can fully understand why they want the feature and how it needs to work.

Few clients mind you asking questions, if anything it tends to give them more confidence that you will continue to be as diligent and thorough if they hire you.

Best of all, if you win the work, by getting granular you have:

An instant statement of work
A defined project scope
The timings you need to put together an accurate project schedule with milestones
Set your client’s expectations very early
Demonstrated your thoroughness and understanding of their business to the client
By being methodical, transparent and getting granular from the very start means your client is well informed and you’re seriously reducing the chances of friction later down the line.

YOU WON THE WORK W00T! TIME TO START TRACKING TIME
The more projects you complete that are categorised with a consistent set of phases and tasks, the more useful data you can collect on how long you estimated versus how long each phase or task actually took.

Consistency here is the key again. By this stage you should have the final project estimate that was approved by the client, and this estimate should be broken down first into the same high-level phases as your previous projects, and then at a granular level by task and sub-task.

Simply replicate this structure and the time estimates for each in your time tracking tool of choice so that you can:

See how long you have to complete each phase
View how long you have for each task and sub-task
At the end, report on how long everything took
Not only is this a perfect way to track the progress of the project you are working on, but the data you collect over multiple projects, using a consistent pattern, will become more and more valuable when it comes to estimating future projects and also allow you to identify bottlenecks in your project processes.

ANALYSE PROJECT ESTIMATES VS. ACTUAL TIME SPENT
Once you have defined a consistent set of high-level project phases to use when estimating all web projects, and committed to setting up your time tracking tool each time to match, you are ready to reap the rewards.

By tracking all the estimated and actual times of all past projects, using a consistent framework, will give you an average percentage that each phase and task took, and you can use these averages as a good guide for starting a new estimate.

For example, by collecting data for your past five projects you are able to identify trends like:

Solution design took around 10% of the total project time to complete and get approved
Web design 30%
Front-end development 15%
Back-end development 30%
And so on…

Using these averages, and with a client’s preferred budget, you can begin to immediately allocate a rough amount of time to each phase and then break out each in more detail, but with the roughly allowed hours available known beforehand.

With this initial capped time limit in place, you can estimate not only your times but also the most cost-efficient solution you can deliver based on the budget rather than going in with a blind quote that may be way to small or too high.

Of course, this is dependent on knowing the client’s budget beforehand, not always possible, but more possible than most seem to think if you just explain you want to deliver the best solution for the budget given that you could potentially offer a News feature that costs £750 or £7,500.

GET GRANULAR WITH FEATURES, AGAIN!
Aside from being able to determine the average percentage of time each high-level phase usually takes of each project, you can take this tracking and analysis one step further.

How many websites or web applications tend to need a feature you’ve implemented before? Small to medium business websites invariably demand the following functionalities:

News
Press Releases
Case Studies
Events
FAQ
Contact us form
At the estimating stage you will have identified these requirements and broken them down as much as you can. Not only can you re-use these common breakdowns in multiple quotes, if you track the time for each one over multiple projects you will also begin to have average times it takes to implement or migrate each feature – now that’s useful.

IN SUMMARY
The approach for estimating time for web projects I have described to you in this article works for me. It’s something I’ve developed over several years through trial and error by having to estimate web projects of all shapes and sizes in a small web agency environment, combined with a lot of good old fashioned hours of research.

Its methodical, it’s laborious, isn’t a guarantee that a project will not go over budget and I’ve no doubt is something I will continue to develop and evolve as time goes by. But as any web project manager will tell you, the more you plan, the more chance there is your project will be successful and the same goes for estimating times.

When possible, resisting the temptation to throw some figures onto a proposal and send it off and instead splitting the project requirements into as granular detail as possible can really be a life saver. It not only identifies possible grey areas early on but forces you to think through everything you’re planning on offering the client and to what extent/scope.

It also presents you to the client as someone, or as an agency, who are very meticulous, diligent and thorough in how they approach things and this is often taken as a signifier of how you will approach the rest of the project and this always gives the client confidence.

Finally, by creating and maintaining a consistent pattern of high-level phases and tasks between your web project time estimates and time tracking means you can collect and analyse reliable data from multiple projects that can help you further increase the accuracy of, and cut the time needed to create, estimates for web projects.

### Setting things up

WEB PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND COLLABORATION USING GITHUB
- January 13, 2014 - by thesambarnes, in Digital Project Management, with 9 comments -

Bio picture of Holly Davis
Holly is a Certified Scrum Master and Agile Project Manager at Award winning web agency White October. We’re currently recruiting a new Project Manager to join the team, feel free to get in touch if you’re interested. You can find Holly on Twitter @ProjectDavis.
A year ago, I had never heard of GitHub and now I’m using it on several of my biggest projects and to my surprise, enjoying doing so!

A cropped version of the GitHub 404 page banner showing it's Octocat character dressed as ObiWan from Star Wars in a desert scene in front of a land speeder and hut.It’s worth using GitHub if only for this each time you type with chubby fingers.
It started just under a year ago when I asked my project team what their preference would be for tracking issues, and the developers were almost evangelical about GitHub. I was aware that most of our active projects were being hosted and deployed from GitHub but didn’t realise it could be used for managing projects too!

So, we took the leap and instead of introducing something new into the mix we started using it to manage tasks, releases and bugs.

The results have far exceeded my expectations, i’ve seen some of the best examples of team collaboration between client, UX, developers, testers and PM, even users have used it to raise bugs or enhancements they’d like to see. This is invaluable for the product owner, who is able to respond to clients directly and add enhancements to the backlog and prioritise accordingly.

Using labels you can create issues for “discussion” i.e. we need a comment system, here are the options giving everyone visibility over the options and the opportunity to comment and be involved with the solution.

A screenshot of low-fi sketches uploaded to GitHubIf I was the client I’d totes sign this off.
GitHub wins on simplicity and its clean interface. Even some of our designers have adopted it for presenting low fidelity sketches to the client / team to review. It’s great to have communication in one centralised place rather than across emails and visible to all the team. You can set up email notifications when people comment or tag you in an issue.

It has also given me more visibility on work in progress. In our daily ODI scrums we have even introduced the reviewing of pull requests. This helps limit work in progress by ensuring pull requests are reviewed, merged and closed. If the same PR is there several days running, it can quickly alert you that something is wrong that you wouldn’t normally be able to pick up on as a non technical PM.

However, like any tool there are a couple of drawbacks. I have had to continue using spreadsheets to track time and velocity over sprints, as you can’t add estimates or track time spent on the issues themselves. However you can assign a milestone to tasks within a sprint which will give you a % indicator of tasks completed but isn’t that helpful if the one task you’ve not completed equates to half the sprint!

Lastly, there is no easy way to prioritise issues. For ODI we’ve added priority 1 and priority 2 tags which work well but i’d like the open issues to work more like a physical backlog where you can click and drag issues to prioritise.

In conclusion, I would recommend using GitHub to other Project Managers, particularly if you’re happy to track project progress outside of GitHub and just embrace it for the ace collaboration tool it is.

If you’re thinking of using GitHub you may want to look at Huboard, a lightweight Kaban board which integrates with GitHub issues.

If that doesn’t fulfil your requirements you may find something that does on this Quora question “Which project management tools are deeply integrated with GitHub?”

### Communication

n element of one of my recent Smashing Magazine articles, Guidelines for Successful Communication with Clients, proved to be of particular interest to a lot of readers, the weekly web project status report for clients.

So here’s a little (well, a lot) more on why they work, what should be in them and a few tips on producing them.

WHY A WEEKLY WEB PROJECT REPORT?
Well first of all it should be said that a web project report does not necessarily have to be compiled and sent to the client on a weekly basis, however I believe this only applies to large projects with big budgets that are spanning over more than six months, but even then the web project report should be sent out once every other week at least!

But let’s assume we’re all talking about your bog standard website or web application project (if there is such a thing), isn’t sending a weekly web project a little too over the top?

Well quite frankly, no.

I’ve lost count of the number of times this approach has made certain conversations with clients infinitely easier, which I’ll explain below, but there are other beneficial reasons too.

CONVEYS PROFESSIONALISM
When it comes to web industry (or any industry for that matter) there are varying quality levels amongst us suppliers, some great and some absolute cowboys – a key part of maturing as a business is to make clients feel looked after to the point where they give you repeat business and referrals to others.

Achieving these key points come from a multitude of factors but consistently coming across as professional when it comes to web project management is one of the most important.

You can deliver the most amazing looking or functionally cutting edge product to your client, but if the road to that delivery leaves the client feeling anything less than 100% confident in your approach to business in general, they could very well think twice before giving you more work or staking their reputation with peers by recommending you.

You’d be surprised how organised ‘paperwork’ (or lack thereof) can influence a client’s impression of you – weekly web project reports contribute to that professional approach that is not only beneficial for you but also your agency.

INTERNAL WEB PROJECT STATUS COMMUNICATION
As you’re going to all that trouble of compiling this ‘easy to digest’ web project report, why not send it to your boss and project team also. By all rights it will contain exactly the information both of them should be interested in and you need to keep them regularly updated on.

HIGHLIGHTS ISSUES
For anyone involved in running web projects you know that on a daily basis any number of issues can rear their ugly head no matter how well it was planned. The weekly web project report can highlight these issues and instigate the conversations that need to happen in order to find a solution.

One benefit of this approach is that all issues are collected and communicated at one time rather than via several conversations at different times and by different means. This is often a more efficient way of dealing with issues and has the added bonus of acting as a high-level ‘in writing’ web project issue log that both you and the client can be held accountable for.

WEB PROJECT SCHEDULE VISIBILITY
It should go without saying why everyone involved in a web project would want a regularly updated understanding of if it’s ahead, on or behind schedule and why. But all too often I see one or two project schedules created (as I described in Part 3 of my Pragmatic Web Project Planning series), in the proposal and for the kick-off meeting, and that’s it for a while – this is a mistake.

What often happens next is milestones are dated, the work begins and the schedule is not communicated again to the client until the first milestone is approaching, which could be weeks from the start of the project – and as we all know, a lot can happen in web projects on a daily basis, let alone weeks.

There are clear benefits to providing a weekly schedule update for agency and client alike.

For both parties it provides the obvious view into the status of the project’s progress and allows decisions to be made on a regular basis that allows for the smoothest path to completion, including needing to secure more resource or de-prioritise requirements to stay on track.

But crucially for the agency and client, a weekly update will aid any conversations that need to be had with regards to schedule revisions, as opposed to ringing the client weeks after starting and trying to explain why you need an extension to a particular phase or task.

As with web project budgets discussed below, if a client is updated on a weekly basis, any changes to the initial project schedule are far easier to sell if they’ve been fully aware of the road that led to this request.

WEB PROJECT BUDGET VISIBILITY
The web project budget update again is pretty self-explanatory and project management 101, but the real benefit of providing regular budget updates is best seen when, like with schedule, budget revisions are needed.

Again, you’ll find it far easier to negotiate additional funding if the client has received a weekly update on budget and was always kept informed of any phases or tasks that were potentially running over, and why – as opposed to if you get to 90% of your design budget after allowing more changes than you wanted and then suddenly drop the “we need more money” line.

With web project schedules and budgets, the key thing to understand is at the start of a project they should both be thought of as ‘initial’ and that only at the end of the project will you know the actual!

Its how you navigate to those ‘actual’ numbers, how happy the client is at the end and how effective your solution has been that really are the true measures of a successful web project.

I’ve witnessed web projects where the solution was delivered a week or two late and only a little over budget, but where the client was left feeling thoroughly in the dark and unloved and thus it felt like a failed project.

However I’ve also seen instances where timelines overran by months and budgets doubled, but because the client had been kept well in the loop and understood along the way why these situations had happened, they were happy bunnies by the end and this was a successful project.

ACTIONS ENCOURAGE MOMENTUM AND ACCOUNTABILITY
Part of the weekly web project report should be actions. This part will list actions for both agency and client, at a high-level, which were completed in the previous week, and actions for both parties to be completed in the following week.

The reason for including actions is simply for web project momentum and accountability.

By this I mean that although a web project schedule may have been produced that has a zillion tasks on it, many clients will be busy with other work and a short list of ‘things they need to do this week’ can be a handy tool for them.

As well as a makeshift to do list, these action lists can also serve as conversations linked to the web project schedule, for example, if in one weekly report a client has an action to deliver content to you and fails to do so and you know this affects the schedule, you can point to specific un-completed actions as causes for slips – again, this transparency and communication helps you out too!

FORCES GOOD WEB PROJECT MANAGEMENT PRACTICE
As busy chainsaw juggling Web Project Managers, one of our constant challenges is sticking to processes when time is short. At times like this it’s all too easy to cut corners and the weekly report is understandably one of the first things deemed as not critical.

A photograph of a man in a shirt and trousers juggling three handheld food blenders lit by a stage spotlight in front of a red stage-like curtainSome Web Project Managers like to exaggerate
However discipline is something that separates average web project managers from great ones.

Not only will the weekly report prove its weight in gold when things don’t go to plan, it also forces the web project manager to keep an eye on every project they’re running and trust me, to effectively stay on top of the multitude of projects you’re likely to have on at any one time you really have to be aware of the most minute detail on a regular basis.

The weekly report forces you to catch up with everyone and analyse the numbers when without you may take the “I’ll review it next week” approach and then one week becomes two – and then the earth falls in on itself and suddenly you’ve lost control of the project.

…and if you don’t believe it’s possible to lose control of a web project a little bit by taking your eye off the ball just for a week or two, you’re sorely mistaken!

WEEKLY WEB PROJECT STATUS REPORT CONTENTS
From the previous section it should be somewhat clear as to what should be included in a weekly web project report, but below is an example list of contents.

Client, web project name, date range the report covers
Actions completed last week
Actions to be completed this week
Web project schedule update
Web project budget update
Complete budget and broken budget down by phase
Questions, comments
Remember, these reports can be delivered in any format you feel is appropriate – some like to use a slide deck or PDF template, but you may find a message template on Basecamp or e-mail template work just as well.

As long as the format remains consistent and clear you’re all good to go!

PRODUCING WEEKLY WEB PROJECT REPORTS
There are many reasons why keeping disciplined enough to produce weekly web project status reports can be a complete ball ache and so below are a few tips that may help you.

YOU DON’T HAVE TO CREATE THE REPORT YOURSELF
Many Web Project Managers have executives or support staff, use them. You setup the template, you create and send the first three or four, but after that there is no reason why a competent executive couldn’t be the ones to dig out the data for you leaving you to adjust schedules, polish up and send on.

ADAPT PER CLIENT
All clients are different and as with web project management approaches, they’ll all react differently to methods of communication and you have to adapt accordingly.

While the fundamentals of the weekly report shouldn’t be changed too much, the way it’s written and delivered should match what you feel the client will be most responsive too. For example, if your client isn’t a ‘details person’ avoid lengthy reports, or if they’re not technical at all, make sure to not include technical web jargon as much as possible.

A screenshot of a Tweet by Dan Storbaek that describes the KISS format for project reports. Keep It Short and Simple.Sexual PM tips from Dan
Adaptation also extends to how you deliver the report, some clients will be happy to just receive it in an e-mail with a short summary, whereas others respond better to the report and quick call to go through it.

Personally I’ll call the client for the first few and then just send through thereafter, unless there are specific elements I’d like to talk to them about.

The important thing is that the client doesn’t see the e-mail arrive in their Inbox, or meeting request reminder pop-up and groan, but instead feel like they’re receiving a professional service and the information included is important.

DON’T DROP BOMBSHELLS IN REPORTS
Although weekly web project reports are the place to capture vital things such as project and budget updates, make sure you don’t let the client find out these facts from the report alone. If any time I feel the total, or phase budget is at risk of overrun, or the schedule is slipping and needs revision, I’ll speak to the client when I realise and not surprise them in the report.

SUMMARY
Producing and sending weekly web project status reports to clients seems like an obvious one, and something many of us start out doing at the beginning of a web project, but as the workload builds up and other projects on your plate are starting or ending, it can often fall by the wayside. This might not seem to be a problem in the short term, but it will become one the minute something doesn’t go according to plan.

From the very beginning it’s important to remain disciplined and send your client a report every week. In this report you should highlight key information such as actions completed, actions to do, schedule and budget updates.

RECORD YOUR WEB PROJECT MANAGEMENT MEETINGS

For once I’m just going to share something I’ve been doing for years that I could now not imagine not doing… dressing up as Princess Leia from Return of the Jedi and re-enacting the ‘lying in front of Jabba’ scene all chained up n stuff.

A picture of toy version of Jabba the Hutt and Princess Leia from a Return of the Jedi sceneAwwwwww, look at cuddly lil Jabba
Ok now that confession is out of the way, I’d also like to let you know how using a digital voice recorder in web project management meetings has proved invaluable time and time again for me when compared to old skool method of note taking with pen and paper.

THE PROBLEM WITH NOTE TAKING
Don’t get me wrong, when it comes to being a Web Project Manager I never go anywhere without my notepad and pen, despite it being a cheap notepad and having never actually owned a pen like a proper grown up.

However there are just some web project management meetings where I get back to the office, look at my notes and realise they no longer make sense as they did in the meeting, but look like a cross between that guy’s tattoos in Prison Break and the scribbles on the wall of a mental case who didn’t leave his room for twenty years before being separated from society.

The web project management meetings I’m talking about are the long ones where you’re required to understand your client’s entire business model, current technical and business workflows and rules, design brief and the oodles of new requirements they have – and all in the space of one or two hours.

Now perhaps I’m just useless at note taking, but the fact is I just can’t remember all that information word for word and got a little scared when I had that inevitable moment we all have from time to time where your eyes glaze over, you see people talking, you nod profusely, but you’re literally hearing nothing.

It was moments like this that resulted in me buying a digital voice recorder – ladies and gentleman, I present to you Excalibur!

A picture of a white digital voice recorder on a wooden surfaceBehold Excalibur – she’s beautiful… innit
THE DIGITAL VOICE RECORDER SOLUTION
Due to my note taking being not great, the primary reason I use a digital voice recorder in detailed web project management meetings is because I want to focus 100% on the meeting and I’m not senior enough to have a PA.

In all seriousness, when I’m talking to a client about their business, project and requirements I genuinely want to immerse myself into the process and really get down and dirty in the details, for two main reasons:

I know off the back of the meeting I will have to probably create a sitemap, functional specification and creative brief and I will need to get the details right
I want the meeting to flow smoothly and be an organic conversation. I find this type of meeting to be brilliantly productive and invariably ends up with both parties getting excited about the web project
Once the meeting is over, I press ‘Stop’ and head on back to the office. I know all that detailed goodness is captured and will be there for me when I need to sit down and write some documents or brief the team – in fact, the team can also listen to the meeting themselves – double efficiency bonus points!

I won’t drone on much more about the why, needless to say the number of times I’ve sat with headphones writing a big functional specification and literally enjoyed capturing a complex piece of functionality perfectly, first time – high bloody five!

ALTERNATIVE RECORDING SOLUTIONS
Of course nowadays digital voice recorders look a little archaic and alternative solutions are available for all you smartphone and tablet people.

A picture of two iOS app icons with a little Yoda cuddly toy face poking out from the bottom-right corner“Clever iOS note taking apps are”
These range from simple voice recorders to awesome apps that let you record a meeting, type notes, draw diagrams, and even highlight the notes and drawings you made in sync with the playback. A few decent ones for the iPad are:

Audionote
Noteability
However, I did try using these and personally found it a little more cumbersome than pen and paper and also made me come across slightly detached from the client, like typing away on a laptop does – but maybe this type of solution will work for you.

NAVIGATING THE EXCALIBUR UNVEILING
Although the theory and practice of recording web project meetings is solid, it’s still a little bit of a taboo when you mention the idea to a client, and to be honest I’m not surprised – it’s not exactly standard practice and there are confidentiality concerns.

But I find, as always with clients, honesty is the best policy and by simply explaining that you want to concentrate 100% on the meeting itself and not note taking, and that it will ensure you capture all the fine detail and enable more efficient briefing and web project documents, you’ll generally get agreement.

In fact clients tend to fall into three camps when they see Excalibur, the:

Happy and understanding type who say “Ooo good idea!”
Tentative but accommodating type who say something along the lines of “Ok, but I won’t see this posted on YouTube will I?” while laughing nervously
Very freaked out type who simply say they do not want to be recorded
The first two types of clients end up not thinking about the recorder 30 seconds into the meeting, and the third type, if you’re smart, you’ll identify before even being silly enough to get the recorder out.

A picture of an oil painting of ex-US President Richard NixonSometimes, recording is just a bad idea
But in case you’re not too smart (like me, trust me I learnt the hard way) here’s a few handy tips on when to suggest recording and when not too.

THE DOS AND DON’TS OF RECORDING
DO
Be completely honest about the fact you’d like to record the meeting, even if it’s a conference call
Make the point to mention you will be discreet with the recording
Name your recordings semantically so you don’t have to trawl through “untitled.mp3″ only to find out it wasn’t the meeting you needed after all
Use your instinct to determine if it would feel appropriate to get the recorder out
DON’T
Try to record pre-sales meetings and conflict resolution meetings
Record meetings where it isn’t necessary e.g. budget discussions
Ever use recordings to try and settle web project disputes
Send recordings to non-employees
Covertly record, ever – it’s just plain wrong and illegal I think
But come on, I’m probably just a bit rubbish when it comes to note taking, and because it’s just not always appropriate to record web project management meetings…

…what are your tips for note taking in web project management meetings?


## Designers

ou know how it usually goes… the client likes your agency and decides to go with you based on one or two great pitch meetings, a stunning proposal that includes the right timeline / budget and a couple of speculative mock-ups of what their new site could look like in your capable hands – brrrrap everyone rejoice!



You sign contracts and NDAs, and it’s time to actually get to work kicking off the project… the first question comes “When can I see some designs?”

To which many a Web Project Manager out there will reply “In a week” – I believe this is a big mistake.

I’ve experienced this approach, and taken my own enough times to back this belief up, let me explain…

THE SPECULATIVE WORK TREND
Before we get onto why I think providing mock-ups too early is a mistake we’ll deal with something some of you may object to right from the off – speculative web design work at the pitch stage.

There is a strong feeling amongst the web elite that providing visual mock-ups as part of the sales process is wrong for many reasons. Back in 2009 Ryan Taylor wrote a very concise article called Why Speculative Design is Wrong listing reasons like:

It costs everybody money
It’s about selling not delivering
It’s wasteful
It’s uninformed
It ignores the collaborative nature of design
I happen to agree with every single word of this post and there have been focussed attempts to champion this approach in the industry, by the likes of NO!!SPEC, in the hope it slowly but surely changes our industry’s attitudes about providing this ‘free’ and misguided work and ultimately eradicates it from the prospective client’s expected sales process.

However, back then, as much as now, I couldn’t help feeling that this would be a hard nut to crack for the very fact that it relies on three things:

Enough web agencies and freelancers get on-board and refuse to do speculative work
Those same agencies and people have a solid enough portfolio that they can rely on as sales aid
They’re skilled enough in sales and client management to sell the ‘no spec’ position and still win the work
I would love this shift to take place and never have to do any speculative design work again, but my gut feeling is this just will never happen on a permanent basis.

A poster of a single from the Irish boy band JedwardUnfortunately some things will never go away
The fact of the matter is I believe it really is only established web agencies and freelancers who can pull this off and the majority of lesser known people out there will always submit to the request for mock-ups and see it, as do most clients, as an integral part of the web sales process.

But while I don’t believe this tradition will change anytime soon, I do believe many agencies then make their first crucial mistake – and it isn’t producing speculative designs, but beginning the web project based on the speculative designs that helped them win the work in the first place.

THE FIRST MISTAKE
I understand it because I learnt the hard way, but some people don’t seem to learn. Three of the reasons Ryan Taylor states as a reason to not do speculative work are actually the exact same reasons why using a pitch design is precisely the wrong thing to base the final design solution off – in fact the “It’s wasteful” reason IS often the result of following this path.

What was the point of producing a piece of design only to discard it? Because ultimately you (the client) are paying for the design it is absurd that you would then choose not to use it.
Ryan Taylor, Why Speculative Design is Wrong

However this statement was made on the assumption that all those who produce speculative designs throw them away upon commencement of the web project, well unfortunately they don’t.

Many out there seem to think it’s best to keep the designs in place for one main reason – if the client loved the designs; it must be what they want. Well maybe yes, but it’s important to identify what the client liked about it before proceeding to base the rest of the web project on it.

All too often it will transpire that the functionality implied by those very early designs, based on probably only 3-4 hours of communication with the client, will actually be built without nearly enough thought given to if they really need it.

What you’ll usually find is the client actually loved the style and colours used in the speculative designs – the final design and functionality should not be set in concrete at this stage.

THE SECOND MISTAKE
The second mistake often made is to start a won web project by briefing your designer to create a homepage and perhaps some sub-page designs for client approval – no no no!

An old photograph of Sam Barnes as a child painting a bad picture on a child's standing upright easelYes, this is me, and yes I’m designing far to early
Why not? Well because at this early stage of the project you still have an awful lot of research to do in order to clarify exactly what the best solution is, from a design and functional perspective, so how can you really expect to produce designs that satisfy the user requirements and ensure that the business goals are aligned with the agreed functionality when they haven’t all been completely agreed yet? Quite simply, you can’t.

Good design comes from being well informed. The designer needs to understand business objectives, success criteria, brand personality, competition and numerous other factors in order to provide the right solution.
Ryan Taylor, Why Speculative Design is Wrong

What invariably happens next when adopting this approach is what I believe to be one of the biggest causes of budget overrun in web projects – the designs will be ‘signed-off’, the functionality will then be agreed and defined, and then come the budget and time sapping design revisions that bring those early homepage and sub-pages in-line with what will actually be built.

Don’t rush straight into solution design and build before you’ve done the groundwork. Take time to create a good plan, gather customer requirements, and create solid functional and technical specifications.
Duncan Haughey, PMP: Six Cliches That Make You a Better Project Manager

Why not just skip these unnecessary revisions altogether with some confident web project and client management skills!

THE ALTERNATIVE APPROACH BOMBSHELL
My approach is to win the web project and then definitely not agree to produce a single design for quite a while.

Image of a stern looking dog on the end of a lead refusing to move despite being pulled by its ownerWeb PMs often have to be stubborn for a project’s sake
Now I know what you’re thinking “Haha you naive fool Mr. Barnes, none of my clients would accept your ridiculous approach, they will insist on designs early and throw a complete hissy fit if I don’t do this for them!”

Well yes, in my experience most clients will not expect this approach easily but that’s when the confidence in the approach must show itself in the form of articulate explanation as to why you follow this approach.

THE ALTERNATIVE APPROACH
It’s at this point, usually in a kick-off meeting, I will explain to the client how the web project will be managed, what phases are involved, in what order they’ll occur and why, and it goes something like this:

I will take the budget and deadline and cast them in concrete (for now)
We’ll then talk, and talk for quite a bit and as we’re no longer in sales mode our conversation will almost certainly be more valuable. In these talks I will discuss your business goals and then cross match them against the functionality laid out in the proposal, crossing some off (with your complete approval and buy in) that actually don’t align with any of your goals and keeping those that do
We’ll then explore those that do in more depth and also discuss other functionality that may not have been in the proposal that would help you achieve your goals, to the point where I can visualise what your requirements are from a design and functional perspective, and have a pretty good idea of how the functionality will work, both in front of and behind the scenes
I’ll then vanish into my web project management Batcave and create an initial project breakdown that lists all the things we’ll need to complete and my estimated hours and hope and pray the total matches the agreed budget
If the numbers match, I’ll walk you through this list and explain that this is the first step to confirming what exactly we’re going to build and deliver and eventually you’ll approve this initial list
Then we produce a sitemap and functional specification for sign-off
Image of a very smarmy looking manager smiling while sitting at a desk with his chin resting on his handsI truly love your project approach Mr. Web Project Manager m’kay
At this point the client may protest and insist on designs much earlier as they “need to know what it will look like” or the “board of Directors want designs” – this is when you start the explanation for wanting to take this ‘crazy’ approach.

CONVINCING CLIENTS ON THE APPROACH
Now this is a debate you may win or lose. Losing means the client listens to your point of view and then says they don’t care, they must have designs first – but winning means you have not only almost certainly and immediately stopped precious web project hours being spent on design revisions, but you’ve also gained the client’s trust and respect – both the most valuable digital account and web project management commodities.

The actual explanation itself is nothing short of a crash course for the client in web design and functional separation. During the crash course you need to communicate five key points:

Achieving the business goals are the primary aim of the web project
The pages that need to be included to meet these goals can be decided independently of what they look like
The functionality (what the website or application must be able to do) is completely irrelevant to any design that will essentially be overlaid on top of the moving parts
By the mere fact the client has hired you means they’ve seen, and liked, the agency’s creative and UX capabilities and need to trust that the same quality level will be applied at the right time
When designs are eventually produced and presented they will be perfectly aligned with the required functionality, sitemap and business goals and thus reduce web project hours required and minimise budget overrun and thus more money needed
I won’t lie to you, most of the time this conversation is not easy and the client will challenge you at certain points, but the real secret lies in your ability to convey absolute conviction in your approach and if possible back it up with examples of previous web projects where the process was, and was not followed.

Retro style poster showing a man hypnotising a lion illustrated by a laser beam from his eyesWeb Project Managers must be able to control clients
For example you could show the client some previous speculative design work, followed by the first set of post-sale designs produced too early, then all subsequent revisions right up until the final version – and then show the amount of hours spent, and duration in work days / weeks, to reach the solution.

This can be followed up quickly by an example where the unorthodox approach was taken and, having used it many times before, I can assure you both the total hours and duration will be comparatively less.

When you start talking in a client’s language about best use of their money and quicker time to market they’ll invariably take a keen interest.

Of course with any web project management approach come challenges and so here are a few tips to help you with this one.

DON’T BE AFRAID TO RIP UP THE PROPOSAL
One thing I’ve learnt over the years is that the sale is the sale, and the project is the project – and both are very different beasts.

An image of a toy Star Wars Stormtrooper looking at a basic cardboard version of a StormtrooperA successful sale can spell for project disaster if badly sold
By this I mean in my early days as a Web Project Manager I used to take a sold web project proposal, with included speculative designs, and pretty much attempt to use those as a statement of work.

As the web project progressed it transpired that some requirements had been misunderstood, were no longer in the same priority and other requirements would emerge – and by the end of the web project, the final solution was often quite far from the outlined solution set out all those months ago – bad times.

Over time I began to view all of the sales documentation as a guide more than a blueprint.

Nowadays, upon receiving all of the sales ‘stuff’ I’ll open talks with the client and define their business goals, target audience, marketing plan and required functionality again. As described earlier in this post, I’ll then create a web project task list with time estimations and see if they match the numbers in the proposal – often they don’t and this is the point at which I’ll start talking to the client about what it would be best to deliver to them for their budget they have.

This may all sound a little odd, and perhaps if the people selling your web projects are amazingly accurate in requirement gathering then you’ll rarely have to go through this step, but in my experience sales documents are pretty high-level and numbers are ‘ball-park’ estimates.

A photograph of the 2007 Fiscal budget for the USA showing the front cover, and the massive amount of pages it containsProject budgets in proposals are rarely this detailed
At the end of the day, when I’m given a web project to manage I consider that it has an initial scope, rough budget and ideal timeline, but that none are final and all are negotiable – and ultimately if I can deliver a solution that the client is happy with, produces commercial return, and my agency can be proud of, then I’ve done my job well and my boss will be happy no matter what he originally sold.

Don’t forget, a happy client is not always one that you delivered a web project for as per the budget and timeline set out in the proposal, but one that is happy with how much they spent on the project and when it was delivered – these numbers and dates are in your control as a Web Project Manager, as is the relationship you form with the client.

I’ve delivered many a web project where it was delivered for twice the cost and weeks or even months later than the original proposal stated, but the client was a very happy person as the process was managed and communicated clearly and the eventual solution was the right one – food for thought.

Ultimately you’re looking for the following client reaction at the end of the web project… is this too much to ask for? I don’t think so.



COLLABORATION IS KEY
Moving ahead on a web project without any designs is not easy for some people, but it can also come across as a very waterfall-based approach where the Web Project Manager works in a silo with the client until such times as he or she are ready to hand over to the web designers and developers – but this is most definitely not the correct path.

At all times a Web Project Manager should be working very closely with everyone in their team, in fact failure to do this will always have a negative impact on the web project – no matter what your approach is.

With regards to my own approach, although I will not produce designs for a client until a sitemap and functional specification have been approved, this doesn’t mean I haven’t been talking to the web designers, UX and development teams while producing both – far from it.

A spoof poster with the large title of Collaborate that shows two women at an office desk - one is looking forward while the other is looking at her colleague, with the tagline - Sometimes your best option is to say it's all her faultWeb project collaboration also has unseen benefits
For example, when writing a functional specification you have to, to some extent, be able to visualise and define certain parts of the website or application that will influence or perhaps even dictate an eventual design or UX factor – but that’s fine – talk though these aspects with the teams, and talk through functionality with developers.

Not only is this collaborative approach getting the key people involved early, which always help to gain buy in and motivate teams, but in most cases a Web Project Manager is not the best person to define any of these things – this is not their expertise.

Part of a Web Project Manager’s expertise however is to get the right people involved at the right time, to utilise the experts in their field and to gently ensure the solutions provided by the experts are within the web project boundaries such as budget, scope and timeline.

THIS WORKS FOR ME, WHAT WORKS FOR YOU?
So this approach works for me, and works well, but as always in web project management different people have different approaches – so tell me

## Developers

his is a topic I’ve wanted to approach for a few years now and is really more of an open question to the digital community… why do developers live by different rules than others at work?

Note: The term ‘developer’ in this article really means anyone working in a digital environment on the production side, you know, people like this.



The ‘rules’ I’m referring to are specifically surrounding the use of Twitter, blog reading, YouTube, Facebook, flexitime and all of the other things that now seem to be a widely expected, and to some extent, accepted part of everyday life in many digital agencies out there i.e. things that many view as a sign of people not doing the job they’re being paid to.

THE CONTEXT SWITCHING ARGUMENT
As a Web Project Manager I’ve heard the two-pronged ‘context switching’ argument a billion times:

More efficient working:
If there wasn’t so much context switching due to meetings and people coming over to me I would work more efficiently.
Reason for poor quality or late delivery:
It’s taken longer due to all of the context switching I experienced.
As someone who, albeit unbelievable to some these days, genuinely used to code for a living, I can completely testify that both of these positions are 100% valid. When you’re coding, designing, or even writing a functional specification or creating a big project schedule – being in ‘the zone’ with no distractions is a must, and distractions are such a pain in the arse for momentum.

Is this the solution? Neat idea, or not practical as not everyone can always help with all queries equally?



However, the point to which I elude to above is that it’s not just coders who work better when context switching is kept to a minimum, but it does seem that these are who you hear about from the most – why is that?

And why is it that having a Twitter client permanently on-screen where Tweets are popping up every second, distracting you unexpectedly from your work is considered to be not context switching?

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
The only reason I’m genuinely curious to hear answers from people on this is because I personally find having things such constantly open on my screen to be a terrible distraction that seriously impedes my productivity and focus.

In fact I find it worse because it tends to be a more frequent occurrence than someone coming over to me or a short-notice meeting being arranged. If I can see a meeting is arranged for two hours time, I’ll tend to work around this necessity rather than complain about it like it’s some big surprise I wasn’t expecting, as do pretty much all other Web Project Managers I’ve worked with – incidentally these people rarely seem to have Twitter open permanently, even the ones who used to design or code.

Is it that I’m just useless as being able to balance these things with my work focus, or is it that it distracts developers just as much as me but they wouldn’t like to admit it in case this culture is stopped dead in its tracks?

DEVELOPER’S JUSTIFICATION
I’ve discussed this subject for quite a few years with developers in various workplaces and forums, and the common reasons given for this culture being a beneficial one tend to boil down to:

It enables me to keep up to date with the latest goings on in the industry.
Having a five minute break to browse Twitter or YouTube helps me relax.
I can’t be expected to work every minute of every day.
My answers to these have remained fixed over the years:

Is there really any industry news that you or the company will benefit from by you knowing about it now as opposed to in a few hours when it’s your lunch, or after work that day?
Fair enough, but often it seems more like more than five minutes, just saying…
Why not, I do (*kind of)
*Caveat: I fully admit I think I talk more than I should at work, usually distracting my very hard working Web Project Manager colleague, and I also take 2-3 cigarette breaks a day, but you know what, many developers do these things also, on top of the ‘Twitter-thang’.

So is it that it’s simply a case that this culture is beneficial to companies, or is it one that isn’t from a commercial perspective, but is just what we’ve all become conditioned to over the years?

A BENEFICIAL CULTURE OR MERELY TOLERATED?
As an employer or Web Project Manager this is ultimately the big question. I don’t know the answer to this, but as far as I see the point and counterpoints are clear.

POINT
Digital folk are a unique bunch of people who generally have a passion for the industry that exceeds the boundaries and hours of their day job.

A photo of Moss from The IT Crowd in a scene where he’s dressed as a barman saying Yes Miss?Most people just don’t understand us and our ways
More to the point, an employer or Web Project Manager, would rather have people with this passion on their team than those who do not as they’ll tend to go above and beyond, stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies and be more dedicated to the solutions they provide, as opposed to those who see their job as just a job and clock off on time every night.

By promoting a culture where they’re allowed to have Twitter open all day long and read blog posts during work hours means you attract and retain the passionate people in the industry rather than the clock watchers.

Developers can choose when to context switch to Twitter, YouTube or blog posts, as opposed to ad hoc disruptions from Web Project Managers, this timing makes all the difference.

Not permitting this culture would result in the passionate people leaving and a ‘corporate’ environment ensuing, and who wants to work in a corporate environment where every minute of every day is tracked.

COUNTERPOINT
If developers spent less time looking at Twitter, YouTube and blog posts throughout the day more work would get done. If more work gets done, the company is more productive and generally more profitable, which means salaries, perks and benefits go up, not to mention the entire team is trusted more and slowly but surely allowed to run things how they want rather than being micro-managed.

By all means watch videos and Tweet during lunch, and maybe a few times during the day, but abusing this culture really impacts on the perception of how hard you’re working, or highlights the fact that perhaps you aren’t. This in turn de-motivates those who feel they’re working harder than you and to bosses who don’t understand the culture, it re-enforces their perception of you being rebellious teenagers who makez web pagez.

A photo of the manager in the TV show The IT Crowd shouting Standard Nerdz!Bosses sometimes subtly stereotype people
The argument that developers deploy, saying that choosing when to context switch makes all the difference seems to fall flat on its face when you cannot predict what or when a Tweet will appear and they’ll inevitably click through to read no matter what they’re doing at the time.

Each time a mistake is made, delivery is late or budgets overrun, if you cite context switching as being a primary reason, to some this will seem tantamount to insulting given that you visibly spent what seems like ‘too long’ on Twitter during either the early phases of the project of launch week.

MY EXPERIENCE, AGAIN
Having worked with and for companies that both promote and discourage this culture, I’ve not seen any major differences between attracting quality staff and/or retaining them.

The only difference I’ve seen is in the attitudes of those at companies who discourage it, and it seems a little more commercially minded and contains a lot less ‘divas’.

On the flipside, companies who encourage or permit it tend to seem much ‘cooler’ and more akin to the Google and Facebook-esque era that we now live in.

A WEB PROJECT MANAGER’S PERSPECTIVE
It will be pretty obvious what side of the argument I personally come down on, but the truth is that’s down to utter selfishness.

By that I mean, I too love what I do, I’m a Web Project Manager and my job boils down to delivering web projects on time, on budget and to a good quality standard. There are things that happen during every single web project that seem to be demanded by the Gods to prevent me, and everyone else in the web project management world, from achieving that.

I expect it to happen, I plan for it, I fight for contingency budget to cater for it – I do lots of things, and sometimes even consider praying to the Gods, but obviously don’t – that discussion is for another time – but I don’t blame you in any way, that’s just how web projects go.

A screenshot of Twitter use GrumpyPM saying if you spend less time moaning and more time doing we can wrap this project up.Behold the Grumpy PM and his infinite wisdom
But while I’m doing all of this to try and make everything run smoothly, as things start to go wrong and the whiners start to whine, I often grumble to myself and others at how the whiners can complain about lack of time or context switching when they’ve found the time to read every Tweet that day, click through to a few links, read the posts and watch several funny videos – it infuriates me – but – I’m ready to understand…

THE BIG FIVE QUESTIONS
If you’ve made it this far or just skipped to the end like Simon Pegg in Spaced, I’m ready to listen, and I want you to help me understand by answering these questions:

Why do you feel context switching when designing or coding is harder than any other context switching for others doing work that requires focussed concentration that perhaps isn’t designing or coding?
Why do you find it acceptable and possible to easily context switch between work and Twitter, blog posts etc. when you say you can’t possibly context switch for pre-planned meetings and general day-to-day disruptions that happen during the average working day?
Why do you quickly click off Twitter, Amazon, Facebook etc. back to work when you see a manager approaching if you don’t think it’s naughty?
Have you ever worked anywhere where this culture was discouraged? What were the big differences?
Do you believe there is real commercial value in this culture? If so can you articulate what it is?
C’mon, sell it to me; sell it to our bosses, please. There must be some Web Project Managers our there who also stay on Twitter all day and read blog posts etc. Why do you find it beneficial? Or, in what way do you see it as a beneficial thing for your project team to be doing?













Continuous Integration makes dev life easier. Happier, better developers and testers. More efficient cycle. Keeps people happy.

It's not about the work that you do, but the work you enable others to do.

Smaller teams can afford to keep goals small and finish them often. Then you can test faster and learn quicker. By working quickly you can make decisions quickly, things flow better, and other teams will be envious. Cut your chunks of work into smaller chunks. Keep going to the minimum. If you can see measured improvement then do the rest of the chunks. If not, you've only lost a day or two maximum. Communicating frequently about what you're releasing makes you feel truly agile. Releasing often not only makes the team look good internally, but improves the end result for users too.

### THINK HOW, NOT WHAT
Your product isn’t just a bunch of features - so stop focusing on them.

What matters is not what functionality your product has, but how it works. A sign-up process is not just a sign-up process, a checkout process is not just a checkout process, a button is not just a button, a rating system is not just a rating system. Think about how you can stand out by introducing something that everyone else might have but in a unique way - what you are selling at it’s core. Here are a few questions to answer:

What is needed for your product to function well?
How much can you take away from it without sacrificing the core product
Why will people be excited about it
Glasses have one primary purpose, to help you see. Everything on top of that - such as colors, shapes, sizes and logos - is a feature. Understand when you are working on your core product and when you are working on adding features. The benefits of thinking like this, is that it will help you establish a very clear and precise picture of what makes your product your product. This will help you understand the minimal work necessary to get a valuable product out the door, and why you are adding features when you are.

You will be surprised how much the “how” can help improving your product - and getting an MVP out the door.

### SHIPPED IS BETTER THAN PERFECT
The goal of sketching, wireframing and prototyping is delivering great product concepts, not great deliverables.

Nobody cares if your deliverables are great if they’re not finished. And few will care how perfect they are even if they are finished. The only people who may marvel at the deliverables are the UX designers, but they’re hopefully too busy to care about internal documentation. On the other hand, everyone wants or absolutely needs you to communicate the right level of details about what they need to do to make a great and feasible solution so they can ship better products, faster.

If you’ve sketched something on scrap paper that you’re confident is a solid solution that everyone can act on immediately, there’s no value in re-creating it in a wireframe or anywhere else. Just take a picture of it and share it where appropriate. In some cases, you may have to quickly replicate it for organizational purposes, but don’t make deliverables for the sake of it - you have better things to do.

When we launched Perch we were, in most cases gently, mocked for writing it in that language everyone loves to hate – PHP. We were quizzed as to why we were not using a trendy NoSQL database. Our technology decisions however, were entirely sensible. They were based on what we knew to be true – that our target customers would not have Python, Ruby on Rails or the latest database available on their cheap hosting. We couldn’t even rely on them to have up to date PHP.

When it comes to launching your own product, it is very tempting to use it as the chance to do all of those things you never get to do in your day job, or on client projects. At last YOU are the client, as a developer there is little more fun than getting to grips with a new technology, building things with the shiniest tools. However, will that serve your customers well? Will they even care, or worse will your latest and greatest languages, tools and techniques actually prevent them from using your product?

PHP isn’t fashionable, a NoSQL database could actually be a great fit for Perch, however if it isn’t available on our target customer’s hosting then there is no point considering it.

The people who will allow you to build a great business around your product are far more invested in your success, because they use your product every day. In our case customers have built their business around selling sites built using Perch. Often they are not developers, but designers and learning a new CMS takes a considerable investment of time. They put a great deal of faith in us, that we won’t turn Perch into something that they can’t use. They trust that we won’t sell out, or otherwise abandon them and we really value that trust.

Understand what people needWe must begin digital projects by exploring and pinpointing the needs of the people who will use the service, and the ways in which the service will fit into their lives. Whether the users are members of the public or government employees, policy makers must include real people in their design process from the very beginning. The needs of people — not constraints of government structures or silos — should drive technical and design decisions. We need to continually test the products we build with real people to keep us honest about what is important.checklist
* Early in the project, spend time with current and prospective users of the service
* Use a range of qualitative and quantitative user research methods to determine people’s goals, needs, and behaviors; be thoughtful about the time spent
* Test prototypes of possible solutions with real people, in the field if possible
* Document the findings about user goals, needs, behaviors, and preferences
* Share findings with the team and agency leadership
* Create a prioritized list of user stories, which are short descriptions of the goals the user is trying to accomplish
* As the digital service is being built, regularly test it with potential users to ensure it will meet peoples’ needs
key questions
    * What user needs will this service address?
    * Why does the user want or need this service?
    * Who are your key users?
    * Which people will have the most difficulty with your service?
    * What research methods were used?
    * What were the key findings from users’ current experience?
    * How were the findings documented? Where can future team members access the documentation?
    * How often are you testing with real people?


Address the whole experience, from start to finishWe must build digital services with an understanding of the range of ways a person might interact with our service, including the actions they take online, through a mobile application, on the phone, or in person. Every encounter should move the user closer towards the desired outcome, whether that encounter is online or offline.checklist
Understand the different points at which people will interact with the service – both online and in person
Identify pain points in the current way users interact with the service, and prioritize these according to user needs
Design the digital parts of the service so that they are integrated with the offline touch points people use to interact with the service
Develop metrics that will measure how well the service is meeting user needs, at each step of the service
key questions
What are the different ways (both online and offline) that people currently accomplish the task the digital service is designed to help with?
Where are user pain points in the current way people accomplish the task?
Where does this specific project fit into the larger way people currently obtain the service being offered?
What metrics will best indicate how well the service is working for its users?

Make it simple and intuitiveUsing a government service shouldn’t be stressful, confusing, or daunting — it’s our job to build services that are simple and intuitive enough that users succeed the first time, unaided.checklist
Create or use an existing, simple, and flexible design style guide for the service
Use the design style guide across related digital services
Provide users with clear information about where they are in the process as they use the service
Follow accessibility best practices to ensure all people can use the service
Provide users with a way to exit and return later to complete the process
Use language that is familiar to the user and is easy to understand
Use language and design consistently throughout the service, including in the online and offline (non-digital) touch points people use to interact with the service
key questions
What primary tasks are the user trying to accomplish?
What is the reading level of the language the service uses?
What languages is your service offered in?
If a user needs help while using the service how do they go about getting it?
How does the service’s design visually relate to other government services?
PLAY 4

Build the service using agile and iterative practicesWe should use an incremental, fast-paced style of software development to reduce the risk of failure by getting working software into users’ hands quickly, and by providing frequent opportunities for the delivery team members to adjust requirements and development plans based on watching people use prototypes and real software. A critical capability is being able to automatically test and deploy the service so that new features can be added often and easily put into production. Following agile methodologies is a proven best practice for building digital services, and will increase our ability to build services that effectively meet user needs.checklist
Ship a functioning “minimum viable product” (MVP) that solves a core user need addressed by the service as soon as possible, and not longer than three months from the beginning of any new digital project, using a “beta” or “test” period if needed
Run usability tests frequently to see how well the service works for users, and identify improvements that should be made
Ensure the individuals building the service are in close communication using techniques such as war rooms, daily standups, and team chat tools
Keep delivery teams small and focused; limit organizational layers that separate these teams from the business owners
Release features and improvements multiple times each month
Create a prioritized list of features and bugs, also known as the “feature backlog” and “bug backlog”
Use an “issue tracker” to catalog features and bugs
Use a source code version control system
Ensure entire team has access to the issue tracker and version control system
Use code reviews to ensure quality
key questions
How long did it take to ship the MVP? If it has not shipped yet, when will it?
How long does it take for a production deployment?
How long in days are the iterations/sprints?
Which source code version control system is being used?
What tool is being used to track bugs and issue tickets?
What tool is being used to manage the feature backlog?
How often do you review and reprioritize the items in your feature and bug backlog?
How do you collect user feedback during development and how is that feedback to improve the service?
At each stage of usability testing, what gaps were identified in addressing user needs?

Choose a modern technology stackThe technology decisions we make need to enable development teams to work efficiently and enable services to scale easily and cost-effectively. Our choices for hosting infrastructure, databases, software frameworks, programming languages and the rest of the technology stack should seek to avoid vendor lock-in and match what successful modern consumer and enterprise software companies would choose today. In particular, digital services teams should consider using open source, cloud based, and commodity solutions across the technology stack, as these solutions have seen widespread adoption and support by the most successful private-sector consumer and enterprise software technology companies.checklist
Choose software frameworks that are commonly used by private-sector companies creating similar services
To the extent practical, ensure that software can be deployed on a variety of commodity hardware types
Ensure that each project has easy to understand instructions for setting up a local development environment, and that team members can be quickly added or removed from projects
Consider open source software solutions at all layers of the stack
key questions
What is your development stack and why did you choose it?
What database(s) are you using and why did you choose them?
How long does it take for a new team member to set up a local development environment?
PLAY 9

Deploy in a flexible hosting environmentOur services should be deployed on flexible infrastructure, where resources can be provisioned in real time to meet spikes in user demand. Our digital services are crippled when we host them in data centers which market themselves as “cloud hosting” but require us to manage and maintain hardware directly. This outdated practice wastes time, weakens our disaster recovery plans, and results in significantly higher costs.checklist
Resources are provisioned on demand
Resources scale based on real-time user demand
Resources are provisioned through an API
Resources are available in multiple regions
We pay only for the resources we use
Static assets are served through a content delivery network
Application is hosted on commodity hardware
key questions
Where is your service hosted?
What hardware does your service use to run?
What is the demand / usage pattern for your service?
What happens to your service when it experiences a surge in traffic or load?
How much capacity is available in your hosting environment?
How long does it take you to provision a new resource such as an application server?
How have you designed your service to scale based on demand?
How are you paying for your hosting infrastructure — i.e., by the minute, hourly, daily, monthly, fixed?
Is your service hosted in multiple regions / availability zones / data centers?
In the event of a catastrophic disaster to a datacenter, how long will it take to have the service operational?
What would be the impact of a prolonged downtime window?
What data redundancy do you have built into the system, and what would be the impact of a catastrophic data loss?
How often do you need to contact a person from your hosting provider to get resources or to fix an issue?
PLAY 10

Automate testing and deploymentsToday, developers write automated scripts that can verify thousands of scenarios in minutes and then deploy updated code into production environments multiple times per day. They use automated performance tests which simulate surges in traffic to identify performance bottlenecks. While manual tests and quality assurance is still necessary, automated tests provide consistent and reliable protection against unintentional regressions, and make it possible for developers to confidently release frequent updates to the service.checklist
Create automated tests that verify all user-facing functionality
Create unit and integration tests to verify modules and components
Run tests automatically as part of the build process
Perform deployments automatically with deployment scripts, continuous delivery services, or similar techniques
Conduct load and performance tests at regular intervals, including before public launch
key questions
What percentage of the code base is covered by automated tests?
How long does it take to build, test, and deploy a typical bug fix?
How long does it take to build, test, and deploy a new feature into production?
How frequently are builds created?
What test tools are used?
What deployment automation or continuous integration tools are used?
What is the estimated maximum number of concurrent users who will want to use the system?
How many simultaneous users could the system handle, according to the most recent capacity test?
How does the service perform when you exceed the expected target usage volume? Does the service degrade gracefully or catastrophically?
What is your scaling strategy when demand increases suddenly?
PLAY 11

Manage security and privacy through reusable processesIt is critical that our digital services protect sensitive information and keep systems secure. This is typically a process of continuous review and improvement which should be built into the development and maintenance of the service. At the start of designing a new service or feature, the team lead should engage the appropriate privacy, security, and legal officer(s) to discuss the type of information collected, how it should be secured, and how it may be used and shared. The sustained engagement of a privacy specialist helps ensure that personal data is properly managed. In addition, a key process to building a secure service is comprehensively testing and certifying the components in each layer of the technology stack for security vulnerabilities, and then to re-use these same pre-certified components for multiple services.The following checklist provides a starting point, but teams should work closely with their privacy specialist and security engineer to meet the needs of the specific service.checklist
Contact the appropriate privacy or legal officer of the department or agency to determine whether a System of Records Notice (SORN), Privacy Impact Assessment, or other review should be conducted
Determine, in consultation with a records officer, what data is collected and why, how it is used or shared, how it is stored and secured, and how long it is kept
Determine, in consultation with a privacy specialist, whether and how users are notified about how personal information is collected and used, including whether a privacy policy is needed and where it should appear, and how users will be notified in the event of a security breach
Consider whether the user should be able to access, delete, or remove their information from the service
“Pre-certify” the hosting infrastructure used for the project using FedRAMP
Use deployment scripts to ensure configuration of production environment remains consistent and controllable
key questions
Does the service collect personal information from the user (whether government or public)? How is the user notified of this collection?
Does it collect more information than is needed to perform the requested task? Are there uses of the data that would not be expected by the average user?
How does a user contact a responsible person to seek access, correction, deletion, or removal of his or her personal information?
Will information stored in the system be shared with others?
How and how often is the service tested for security vulnerabilities?
How can someone from the public report a security issue?

Use data to drive decisionsAt all stages of a digital project, we should measure how well our service is working for our users. This includes measuring how well a system performs and how people are interacting with the system in real time. Our teams and agency leadership should carefully watch these metrics to proactively spot issues and identify which improvements should be prioritized. In addition to monitoring tools, a feedback mechanism should be in place for people to report issues directly.checklist
Monitor system-level resource utilization in real time
Monitor system performance, measuring response time, latency, throughput, and error rates in real-time

Default to openWhen we collaborate in the open and publish our data publicly we can improve Government together. By building services more openly and publishing open data, we simplify the public’s access to government services and information, allow the public to easily provide fixes and contributions, and enable reuse by entrepreneurs, nonprofits, other agencies, and the public.checklist
Offer users a mechanism to report bugs and issues, and be responsive to these reports
Provide datasets to the public, in their entirety, through bulk downloads and APIs (application programming interfaces)
Ensure that data from the service is explicitly in the public domain, and that rights are waived globally via an international public domain dedication, such as the “Creative Commons Zero” waiver

Ensure that we maintain the rights to all data developed by third parties in such a manner that is releasable and reusable at no cost to the public
Ensure that we maintain contractual rights to all custom software developed by third parties in such a manner that is publishable and reusable at no cost
When appropriate, create an API for third parties to interact with the service directly
When appropriate, publish source code of projects or components online
When appropriate, share your development process and progress publicly

What is a product manager? What do product managers do all day? Most importantly, why do companies need to hire them? Good questions.
The first confusion we have to clear up is what we mean by “product.” In the context of software development, a product is the website, application or online service that users interact with. Depending on the size of the company and its products, a product manager could be responsible for an entire system (such as a mobile app) or part of a system (such as the checkout flow on an e-commerce website across all devices).
This is confusing because, in most contexts, a product is a thing you sell to people. Particularly in e-commerce, product managers often get confused with category managers, which are the team that sources and merchandises the products sold on an e-commerce website. So, yes, “product” probably isn’t the best word for it. But it’s what we’ve got, and it’s the word we’ll refer to in exploring this role.
To define the role of a product manager, let’s start by looking at Marc Andreessen’s view of the only thing that matters in a startup:
The quality of a startup’s product can be defined as how impressive the product is to one customer or user who actually uses it: How easy is the product to use? How feature rich is it? How fast is it? How extensible is it? How polished is it? How many (or rather, how few) bugs does it have?
The size of a startup’s market is the the number, and growth rate, of those customers or users for that product.…
The only thing that matters is getting to product-market fit. Product-market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.
Even though Andreessen wrote this for startups, the importance of that last sentence about product-market fit holds truth for every organization — whether the organization is getting a new product to market or redesigning an existing experience or anything in between. It is a universal road map to success, and it is the core of what product managers are responsible for.
With that as the backdrop, my definition of the role of a product manager would be to achieve business success by meeting user needs through the continual planning and execution of digital product solutions.
This definition summarizes all of the things that a product manager needs to obsess over: the target market, the intricacies of the product, what the business needs in order to succeed, and how to measure that success. It also encapsulates the three things that a product manager should never lose sight of:
The ultimate measure of success is the health of the business and, therefore, the value that the product provides to users.
Everything starts with a solid understanding of the target market and its needs, so that the focus remains on the quality of the product experience.
A continual cycle of planning and execution is required to meet these market needs in a sustainable way.
So, how does this translate to what a product manager does every day? That question is way too big to answer here, but as an introduction, Marty Cagan has a great list of common tasks that product managers are responsible for in his ebook Behind Every Great Product (PDF). The tasks include:
identifying and assessing the validity and feasibility of product opportunities,
making sure the right product is delivered at the right time,
developing a product strategy and road map for development,
leading the team in executing the product’s road map,
evangelizing the product internally to the executive team and colleagues,
representing customers through the product development process.
But before a product manager is able to do these things, a couple of awkward questions have to be asked. First, do companies really need product managers? And, if we can agree on that, what are the characteristics of a good one? Also, where does this role fit in an organization’s structure? Let’s explore these questions.
Why Companies Need Product Managers
The role of product manager can be a hard sell for some companies. Common objections to it include:
“We have various people in the organization whose roles fulfill each of these functions.”
“I don’t see how the role would make us more money.”
“Product managers would just slow us down.”
“I don’t want to relinquish control of the product to someone else.” (OK, this one is not usually said out loud.)
These appear to be valid concerns, but only if the role is not well understood — or if the organization has bad product managers who perpetuate these perceptions.
The truth is that, to be effective, the role of a manager for a particular product or area must not be filled by multiple people. It is essential for the product manager to see the whole picture — the strategic vision as well as the details of implementation — in order to make good decisions about the product. If knowledge of different parts of the process resides in the heads of different people, then no one will have that holistic view, and all value will be drained of the role.
Let’s look at two major benefits that product managers bring.
PRODUCT MANAGERS ENSURE A MARKET-DRIVEN APPROACH
The key argument in favor of product managers is that they help companies to be driven by the needs and goals of the target market, not the forces of technology or fads. As Barbara Nelson puts it in “Who Needs Product Management?”:
It is vastly easier to identify market problems and solve them with technology than it is to find buyers for your existing technology.
If done right, a market-driven focus results in long-term, sustainable, profitable business, because the company will remain focused on solving market problems, as opposed to looking for things to do with the latest technologies. A market-driven focus is important because companies that have one are proven to be more profitable than those driven by other factors (31% more profitable, according to George S. Day and Prakash Nedungadi).
This doesn’t mean focusing on incremental change to the exclusion of product innovation. Identifying market problems is about not only finding existing issues to improve (for example, “60% of users drop off on this page, so let’s fix that”), but also about creating new products to satisfy unmet needs (“Cell phones suck — let’s make a better one”).
PRODUCT MANAGERS IMPROVE TIME-TO-EVERYTHING
The second major benefit of product managers is that they reduce the time an organization takes to reach its goals. A well-defined and appropriate product development process run by effective managers will improve both the time-to-market as well as the time-to-revenue.
The reason for the faster turnaround time is that a product manager is responsible for figuring out what’s worth building and what’s not. This means less time spent on the spaghetti approach to product development (throwing things against the wall to see what sticks) and more time spent on building products that have been validated in the market. This approach also sharpens the organization’s focus, enabling the organization to dedicate more people to products that are likely to succeed, instead of spreading people too thin on projects that no one is sure will have a product-market fit.



7 Principles of Rich Web Applications

November 4, 2014 – 127504 views
This is a writeup based on a presentation I gave at BrazilJS in August 2014. It builds on some of the ideas I’ve been blogging about recently related mostly to UX and performance.

I want to introduce 7 actionable principles for websites that want to make use of JavaScript to control their UI. They are the result of my experience as a web developer, but also as a long-time user of the WWW.

JavaScript has undeniably become an indispensable tool for frontend developers. Its usage is now expanding into other areas like servers and microcontrollers. It’s the language of choice for introducing computer science concepts by prestigious universities.

Yet a lot of questions on its precise role and usage on the web remain a mystery, even to many framework and library authors.

Should JavaScript be used to replace browser functions like history, navigation and page rendering?
Is the backend dying? Should I render HTML at all?
Are Single Page Applications (SPAs) the future?
Is JS supposed to augment pages for websites, but render pages in web apps?
Should techniques like PJAX or TurboLinks be used?
What’s the precise distinction between a website and a web application? Should there be one at all?
What follows is my attempt to answer these. My approach is to examine the usage of JavaScript exclusively from the lens of user experience (UX). In particular, I put a strong focus on the idea of minimizing the time it takes the user to get the data they are interested in. Starting with networking fundamentals all the way to predicting the future.

Server rendered pages are not optional
Act immediately on user input
React to data changes
Control the data exchange with the server
Don’t break history, enhance it
Push code updates
Predict behavior
 1. Server rendered pages are not optional

tl;DR: Server rendering is not about SEO, it’s about performance. Consider the additional roundtrips to get scripts, styles, and subsequent API requests. In the future, considering HTTP 2.0 PUSH of resources.
The first thing I’m compelled to point out is a fairly common false dichotomy. That of “server-rendered apps vs single-page apps”. If we want to optimize for the best possible user experience and performance, giving up one or the other is never a good idea.

The reasons are fairly straightforward. The medium by which pages are transmitted, the internet, has a theoretical speed limit. This has been memorably illustrated by the famous essay/rant “It’s the latency, stupid” by Stuart Cheshire:

The distance from Stanford to Boston is 4320km.
The speed of light in vacuum is 300 x 10^6 m/s.
The speed of light in fibre is roughly 66% of the speed of light in vacuum.
The speed of light in fibre is 300 x 10^6 m/s * 0.66 = 200 x 10^6 m/s.
The one-way delay to Boston is 4320 km / 200 x 10^6 m/s = 21.6ms.
The round-trip time to Boston and back is 43.2ms.
The current ping time from Stanford to Boston over today’s Internet is about 85ms (…)
So: the hardware of the Internet can currently achieve within a factor of two of the speed of light.

The cited 85ms round-trip time between Boston and Stanford will certainly improve over time, and your own experiments right now might already show it. But it’s important to note that there’s a theoretical minimum of about 50ms between the two coasts.

The bandwidth capacity of your users’ connections might improve noticeably, as it steadily has, but the latency needle won’t move much at all. This means that minimizing the number of roundtrips you make to display information on page is essential to great user experience and responsiveness.

This becomes particularly relevant to point out considering the rise of JavaScript-driven applications that usually consist of no markup other than <script> and <link> tags beside an empty <body>. This class of application has received the name of “Single Page Applications” or “SPA”. As the name implies, there’s only one page the server consistently returns, and all the rest is figured out by your client side code.

Consider the scenario where the user navigates to http://app.com/orders/ after following a link or typing in the URL. At the time your application receives and processes the request, it already has important information about what’s going to be shown on that page. It could, for example, pre-fetch the orders from the database and include them in the response. In the case of most SPAs, a blank page and a <script> tag is returned instead, and another roundtrip will be made to get the scripts contents. So that then another roundtrip can be made to get the data needed for rendering.

Analysis of the HTML sent by the server for every page of a SPA in the wild

At this point many developers consciously accept this tradeoff because they make sure the extra network hops happen only once for their users by sending the proper cache headers in the script and stylesheet responses. The general consensus is that it’s an acceptable tradeoff because once the bundle is loaded, you can then handle most of the user interaction (like transitions to other pages) without requesting additional pages or scripts.

However, even in the presence of a cache, there’s a performance penalty when considering script parsing and evaluation time. “Is jQuery Too Big For Mobile?” describes how even for jQuery alone this could be in the order of hundreds of milliseconds for certain mobile browsers.

What’s worse, usually no feedback whatsoever is given to the user while the scripts are loading. This results in a blank page displaying and then a sudden transition to a fully loaded page.

Most importantly, we usually forget that the current prevailing transport of internet data (TCP) starts slowly. This pretty much guarantees that most script bundles won’t be fetched in one roundtrip, making the situation described above even worse.

A TCP connection starts with an initial roundtrip for the handshake. If you’re using SSL, which happens to be important for safe script delivery, an additional two roundtrips are used (only one if the client is resuming a session). Only then can the server start sending data, but as it turns out, it does so slowly and incrementally.

A congestion control mechanism called slow start is built into the TCP protocol to send the data in a growing number of segments. This has two serious implications for SPAs:

Large scripts take a lot longer to download than it seems. As explained in the book “High Performance Browser Networking” by Ilya Grigorik, it takes “four roundtrips (…) and hundreds of milliseconds of latency, to reach 64 KB of throughput between the client and server”. In this example, considering a great internet connection between London and New York, it takes 225ms before TCP is able to reach the maximum packet size.
Since this rule applies also for the initial page download, it makes the initial content that comes rendered with the page all that much more important. As Paul Irish concludes in his presentation “Delivering the Goods”, the first 14kb are crucially important. This is a helpful illustration of the amount of data the server can send in each round-trip over time:

How many KB a server can send for each phase of the connection by segments.
How many KB a server can send for each phase of the connection by segments

Websites that deliver content (even if it’s only the basic layout without the data) within this window will seem extremely responsive. In fact, to many authors of fast server-side applications JavaScript is deemed unneeded or as something to be used sparingly. This bias is further strengthened if the app has a fast backend and data sources and its servers located near users (CDN).

The role of the server in assisting and speeding up content presentation is certainly application-specific. The solution is not always as straightforward as “render the entire page on the server”.

In some cases, parts of the page that are not essential to what the user is likely after are better left out of the initial response and fetched later by the client. Some applications, for example, opt to render the “shell” of the page to respond immediately. Then they fetch different portions of the page in parallel. This allows for great responsiveness even in a situation with slow legacy backend services. For some pages, pre-rendering the content that’s “above the fold” is also a viable option.

Making a qualitative assessment of scripts and styles based on the information the server has about the the session, the user and the URL is absolutely crucial. The scripts that deal with sorting orders will obviously be more important to /orders than the logic to deal with the settings page. Maybe less intuitively, one could also make a distinction between “structural CSS” and the “skin/theme CSS”. The former might be required by the JavaScript code, so it should block, but the latter could be loaded asynchronously.

A neat example of a SPA that does not incur in extra roundtrip penalties is a proof-of-concept clone of StackOverflow in 4096 bytes (which can theoretically be delivered on the first post-handshake roundtrip of a TCP connection!). It manages to pull this off at the expense of cacheability, by inlining all the assets within the response. With SPDY or HTTP/2 server push, it should be theoretically possible to deliver client code that’s cacheable in a single hop. For the time being, rendering part or all of the page on the server is the most common solution to avoiding extra roundtrips.

A flexible enough system that can share rendering code between browser and server and provides tools for progressively loading scripts and styles will probably eliminate the colloquial distinction between websites and webapps. Both are reigned by the same UX principles. A blog and a CRM are fundamentally not that different. They have URLs, navigation, they show data to the user. Even a spreadsheet application, which traditionally relies a lot more on client side functionality, first needs to show the user the data he’s interested in modifying. And doing so in the least number of network roundtrips is paramount.

In my view, the major tradeoffs in performance seen in many widely deployed systems these days have to do with the progressive accumulation of complexity in the stack. Technologies like JavaScript and CSS were added over time. Their popularity increased over time as well. Only now can we appreciate the impact of the different ways they’ve been applied. Some of this is addressed by improving protocols (as shown by the ongoing enhancements seen in SPDY and QUIC), but the application layer is where most of the benefits will come from.

It’s helpful to refer to some of the initial discussions around the design of the initial WWW and HTML to understand this. In particular, this mailing list thread from 1997 proposing the addition of the <img> tag to HTML. Marc Andreessen re-iterates the importance of serving information fast:

“If a document has to be pieced together on the fly, it could get arbitrarily complex, and even if that were limited, we’d certainly start experiencing major hits on performance for documents structured in this way. This essentially throws the single-hop principle of WWW out the door (well, IMG does that too, but for a very specific reason and in a very limited sense) — are we sure we want to do that?”

 2. Act immediately on user input

tl;DR: JavaScript allows us to mask network latency altogether. Applying this as a design principle should even remove most spinners or “loading” messages from your applications. PJAX or TurboLinks miss out on opportunities to improve the perception of speed.
The first principle builds heavily on the idea of minimizing latency as the user interacts with your website.

That said, despite how much effort you invest into minimizing the back-and-forth between server and client, there’s a few things beyond your control. A theoretical lower bound given by the distance between your user and your server being the unescapable one.

Poor or unpredictable network quality being the other significant one. If the network connection is not great, packet re-transmission will occur. What you would expect to result in a couple roundtrips could end up taking several.

And in this lies JavaScript’s greatest strength towards improving UX. With client-side code driving user interaction, we are now able to mask latency. We can create the perception of speed. We can artificially approach zero latency.

Let’s consider the basic HTML web again for a second. Documents connected together through hyperlinks, or <a> tags. When any of them are clicked, the browser will make a network request that’ll take unpredictably long, then get and process its response and finally transition to the new state.

JavaScript allows to act immediately and optimistically on user input. A click on a link or button can result in an immediate reaction without hitting the network. A famous example of this is Gmail (or Google Inbox), where archiving an email will happen immediately on the UI while the server request is sent and processed asynchronously.

In the case of a form, instead of waiting for some HTML as a response after its submission, we can act right after the user presses enter. Or even better, like Google Search does, we can respond to the user holding down a key:

Google adapts its layout as soon as you hold down a key
Google adapts its layout as soon as you hold down a key

That particular behavior is an example of what I call layout adaptation. The basic idea is that the first state of a page “knows” about the layout of the next state, so it can transition to it before there’s any data to populate the page with. It’s “optimistic” because there’s still a risk that the data never comes and an error should be displayed instead, but that’s obviously rare.

Google’s homepage is particularly relevant to this essay because its evolution illustrates the first two principles we’ve discussed very clearly.

First of all, analyzing the packet dump of the TCP connection to www.google.com reveals they make sure to send their entire homepage all at once after the request comes in. The whole exchange, including closing the connection, takes 64ms for me in San Francisco. This has likely been the case ever since the beginning.

In late 2004, Google pioneered the usage of JavaScript to provide inline as-you-type suggestions (curiously, as a 20% time project, like Gmail). This even became an inspiration for coining AJAX:

Take a look at Google Suggest. Watch the way the suggested terms update as you type, almost instantly … with no waiting for pages to reload. Google Suggest and Google Maps are two examples of a new approach to web applications that we at Adaptive Path have been calling Ajax

And in 2010 they introduced Instant Search, which puts JS front and center by skipping the page refresh altogether and transitioning to the “search results” layout as soon as you press a key as we saw above.

Another prominent example of layout adaptation is most likely in your pocket. Ever since the early days, iPhone OS would request app authors to provide a default.png image that would be rendered right away, while the actual app was loading.

iPhone OS enforced loading default.png before the application
iPhone OS enforced loading default.png before the application

In this case, the OS was compensating not necessarily for network latency, but CPU. This was crucial considering the constraints of the original hardware. There’s however a scenario where this technique breaks. That would be when the layout doesn’t match the stored image, as in the case of login screens. A thorough analysis of its implications was provided by Marco Arment in 2010.

Another form of input besides clicks and form submissions that’s greatly enhanced by JavaScript rendering is file input.

We can capture the user’s intent to upload through a variety of means: drag and drop, paste, file picker. Then, thanks to new HTML5 APIs we can display content as if it had been uploaded. An example of this in action is in the work we did with Cloudup uploads. Notice how the thumbnail is generated and rendered immediately:

The image gets rendered and fades in before the upload completes
The image gets rendered and fades in before the upload completes

In all of these cases, we’re enhancing the perception of speed. Thankfully, there’s plenty of evidence that this is a good idea. Consider the example of how increasing the walk to baggage claim reduced the number of complaints at the Houston Airport, without necessarily making baggage handling faster.

The application of this idea should have very profound implications on the UI of our applications. I contend that spinners or “loading indicators” should become a rarity, especially as we transition to applications with live data, discussed in the next section.

There’s situations where the illusion of immediacy could actually be detrimental to UX. Consider a payment form or a logout link. Acting optimistically on those, telling the user everything is done when it’s not, can result in a negative experience.

But even in those cases, the display of spinners or loading indicators should be deferred. They should only be rendered after the user no longer considers the response was immediate. According to the often-cited research by Nielsen:

The basic advice regarding response times has been about the same for thirty years Miller 1968; Card et al. 1991:
0.1 second is about the limit for having the user feel that the system is reacting instantaneously, meaning that no special feedback is necessary except to display the result.
1.0 second is about the limit for the user’s flow of thought to stay uninterrupted, even though the user will notice the delay. Normally, no special feedback is necessary during delays of more than 0.1 but less than 1.0 second, but the user does lose the feeling of operating directly on the data.
10 seconds is about the limit for keeping the user’s attention focused on the dialogue. For longer delays, users will want to perform other tasks while waiting for the computer to finish

Techniques like PJAX or TurboLinks unfortunately largely miss out on the opportunities described in this section. The client side code doesn’t “know” about the future representation of the page, until an entire roundtrip to the server occurs.

 3. React to data changes

tl;DR: When data changes on the server, let the clients know without asking. This is a form of performance improvement that frees the user from manual refresh actions (F5, pull to refresh). New challenges: (re)connection management, state reconciliation.
The third principle is that of reactivity of the UI with respect to data changes in the source, typically one or more database servers.

Serving an HTML snapshot of data that remains static until the user refreshes the page (traditional websites) or interacts with it (AJAX) is increasingly becoming obsolete.

Your UI should be self-updating.

This is crucially important in a world of an ever-increasing number of data points, in the form of watches, phones, tablets and wearable devices yet to be designed.

Consider the Facebook newsfeed at the time of its inception, when data was primarily entered through personal computers. Rendering it statically was not optimal, but it made sense if people were updating their profiles maybe once a day, if that.

We now live in a world where you can upload a photo, and have your peers like it or comment on it almost immediately. The need for realtime feedback is natural due to the highly concurrent usage of the application.

It would be wrong, however, to assume that the benefits of reactivity are limited to multi-user applications. Which is why I like to talk about  concurrent data points as opposed to users. Consider the common scenario of sharing a photo you have on your phone with your own laptop:

A single-user application can still benefit from reactivity
A single-user application can still benefit from reactivity

It’s useful to think of all the data exposed to the user as reactive. Session and login state synchronization is an example of applying this principle uniformly. If users of your application have multiple tabs open simultaneously, logging out of one will invalidate them all. This inevitably results in enhanced privacy and security, especially in situations where multiple people have access to the same device.

Each page reacts to the session and login state
Each page reacts to the session and login state

Once you set up the expectation that the information on the screen updates automatically, it’s important to consider a new need: state reconciliation.

When receiving ordered atomic data updates, it’s easy to forget that your application should be able to update appropriately even after long periods of disconnection. Consider the scenario of closing your laptop’s lid and reopening it days later. What how does your app behave then?

Example of what would occur if we disregard elapsed time upon reconnection
Example of what would occur if we disregard elapsed time upon reconnection

The ability for your application to reconcile states disjointed in time is also relevant to our first principle. If you opt to send data with the initial page load, you must consider the time the data is on the wire until your client-side scripts load. That time is essentially equivalent to a disconnection, and the initial connection by your scripts is a session resumption.

 4. Control the data exchange with the server

tl;DR: We can now fine-tune the data exchange with the server. Make sure to handle errors, retry on behalf of the user, sync data on the background and maintain offline caches.
When the WWW was conceived, data exchange between the client and server was limited to a few ways:

clicking a link would GET a new page and render the new page
submitting a form would POST or GET and render a new page
embedding an image or object would GET it asynchronously and render it
The simplicity of this model is attractive, and we certainly have a much higher learning curve today when it comes to understanding how data is sent and received.

The biggest limitations were around the second point. The inability to send data without necessarily triggering a new page load was not optimal from a performance standpoint. But most importantly, it completely broke the back button:


Possibly the most annoying artifact of the old web

The web as an application platform was thus inconceivable without JavaScript. AJAX constituted a leapfrog in terms of the user experience around user submission of information.

We now have a variety of APIs (XMLHttpRequest, WebSocket, EventSource to name a few) that give us fine-grained control of the data flow. In addition to the ability to send data the user inputs into a form, we now have some new opportunities to enhance UX.

One that’s specially relevant to our previous principle is the ability to display the connection state. If we set up the expectation that the data updates automatically, we ought to notify the user about being disconnected and ongoing reconnection attempts.

When detecting a disconnection, it’s useful to store data in memory (or even better, localStorage) so that it can be sent later. This is specially important in light of the introduction of ServiceWorker, which enables JavaScript web applications to run in the background. If your application is not open, you can still attempt to sync user data in the background.

Consider timeouts and errors when sending data and retry on behalf of the user. If a connection is re-established, attempt to send the data again. In the case of a persistent failure, communicate it to the user.

Certain errors should be handled carefully. For example, an unexpected 403 could mean the user’s session has been invalidated. In such cases, you have the opportunity to prompt the user to resume it by showing a login screen.

It’s also important to make sure the user doesn’t inadvertently interrupt the data flow. This can happen under two situations. The first and most obvious one is closing the browser or tab, which you can attempt to prevent with beforeunload handlers.


The beforeunload browser warning

The other (and less obvious) one is capturing page transitions before they happen, like clicking links that trigger a new page load. This gives you a chance to display your own modals.

 5. Don’t break history, enhance it

tl;DR: Without the browser managing URLs and history for us, new challenges emerge. Make sure not to break expectations related to scrolling. Keep your own caches for fast feedback.
Form submissions aside, if we were to design any modern web application with only hyperlinks, we’d end up with fully functional back/forward navigation.

Consider, for example, the typical “infinite pagination scenario”. The typical way it’s implemented involves capturing the click with JavaScript, requesting some data / HTML, injecting it. Making the history.pushState or replaceState call is an optional step, unfortunately not taken by many.

And this is why I use the word “break”. With the simpler model the web proposed initially, this situation was not in the picture. Every state transition relied on a URL change.

The flip side of this is that new opportunities emerge for enhancing history now that we can control it with JavaScript.

One such opportunity is what Daniel Pipius dubbed Fast Back:

Back should be quick; users don’t expect data to have changed much.

This is akin to considering the back button an application-level button and applying principle 2: act immediately on user input. The key is that you can now decide how to cache the previous page and render it instantly. You can then apply principle 3 and then inform the user of new data changes that happened to that page.

There’s still a few cases where you won’t be in control of the caching behavior. For example, if you render a page, then navigate to a third party website, and the user clicks back. Applications that render HTML on the server and then modify it on the client are at particular risk of this subtle bug:


Pressing back incorrectly loads the initial HTML from the pageload

Another way of breaking navigation is by ignoring scrolling memory. Once again, pages that don’t rely on JS and manual history management most likely won’t have an issue with this. But dynamic ones usually do. I tested the two most popular JavaScript-driven newsfeeds of the web: Twitter and Facebook. Both exhibited scrolling amnesia.


Infinite pagination is usually susceptible to scrolling amnesia

Finally, be aware of state changes that are relevant only while navigating history. Consider this example of toggling the display of comment subtrees.


The toggling of comments should be preserved when navigating history

If the page was re-rendered by following a link within the application, the expectation of the user might be that all comments appear uncollapsed. The state was volatile and only associated with the entry in the history stack.

 6. Push code updates

tl;DR: Pushing data without pushing code is insufficient. If your data updates automatically, so should your code. Avoid API errors and improve performance. Use stateless DOM for side-effect free repainting.
Making your application react to code changes is crucially important.

First of all, it reduces the surface for possible errors and increases reliability. If you make a breaking change to your backend APIs, then clients’ code must be updated. They might otherwise not be able to understand new data, or they may send data in an incompatible format.

Another equally important reason has to do with the implementation of principle #3. If your UI is self-updating, there’s little reason for users to trigger a page refresh.

Keep in mind that in a traditional website, a page refresh accomplishes two things: reload the data and reload the code. Setting up a mechanism to push data without one to push code is not enough, especially in a world where a single tab (session) might stay open for a very long time.

If a server push channel is in place, a notification can be emitted to clients when new code is available. In the absence of that, a version number can be appended as a header to outgoing HTTP requests. The server can then compare it to its latest known version, opt to handle request or not, and advice the client.

After this, some web applications opt to refresh the page on behalf of the user when deemed appropriate. For example, if the page is not visible and no form inputs are filled out.

A better approach is to perform hot code reloading. This means that there would be no need to perform a full page refresh. Instead, certain modules can be swapped on the fly and their code re-executed.

It’s certainly hard to make hot code reloading work for many existing codebases. It’s worth discussing then a type of architecture that elegantly separates behavior (code) from data (state). Such a separation would allow us to make a lot of different patches very efficient.

Consider for example a module in your application that sets up an event bus (e.g: socket.io). When events are received, the state of a certain component is populated and it renders to the DOM. Then you modify the behavior of that component, for example, so that it produces different DOM markup for existing and new state.

The ideal scenario is that we’re able to update the code on a per-module basis. It wouldn’t make sense to restart the socket connection, for example, if we can get away with just updating the modified component’s code. Our ideal architecture for hot-code pushing is thus modular.

But the next challenge is that modules should be able to be re-evaluated without introducing undesirable side effects. This is where an architecture like the one proposed by React comes particularly handy. If a component code is updated, its logic can be trivially re-executed and the DOM efficiently updates. An exploration of this concept by Dan Abramov can be found here.

In essence, the idea that you render to the DOM (or paint it) is what significantly helps with hot code swapping. If state was kept in the DOM, or event listeners where set up manually by your application, updating code would become a much more complicated task.

 7. Predict behavior

tl;DR: Negative latency.
A rich JavaScript application can have mechanisms in place for predicting the eventual user input.

The most common application of this idea is to preemptively request data from the server before an action is consummated. Starting to fetch data when you hover a hyperlink so that it’s ready when it’s clicked is a straightforward example.

A slightly more advanced method is to monitor mouse movement and analyze its trajectory to detect “collisions” with actionable elements like buttons. A jQuery example:

jQuery plugin that predicts the mouse trajectory

 Conclusion

You Are Solving The Wrong Problem


There is some problem you are trying to solve. In your life, at work, in a design. You are probably solving the wrong problem. Paul MacCready, considered to be one of the best mechanical engineers of the 20th century, said it best: “The problem is we don’t understand the problem.”

Story time.

It’s 1959, a time of change. Disney releases their seminal film Sleeping Beauty, Fidel Castro becomes the premier of Cuba, and Eisenhower makes Hawaii an official state. That year, a British industry magnate by the name of Henry Kremer has a vision that leaves a haunting question: Can an airplane fly powered only by the pilot’s body power? Like Da Vinci, Kremer believed it was possible and decided to push his dream into reality. He offered the staggering sum of £50,000 for the first person to build a plane that could fly a figure eight around two markers one half-mile apart. Further, he offered £100,000 for the first person to fly across the channel. In modern US dollars, that’s the equivalent of $1.3 million and $2.5 million. It was the X-Prize of its day.

Thanks to Alan Kay for turning me on to this story.

A decade went by. Dozens of teams tried and failed to build an airplane that could meet the requirements. It looked impossible. Another decade threatened to go by before our hero, MacCready, decided to get involved. He looked at the problem, how the existing solutions failed, and how people iterated their airplanes. He came to the startling realization that people were solving the wrong problem. “The problem is,” he said, “that we don’t understand the problem.”

MacCready’s insight was that everyone working on solving human-powered flight would spend upwards of a year building an airplane on conjecture and theory without the grounding of empirical tests. Triumphantly, they’d complete their plane and wheel it out for a test flight. Minutes later, a years worth of work would smash into the ground. Even in successful flights, a couple hundred meters later the flight would end with the pilot physically exhausted. With that single new data point, the team would work for another year to rebuild, retest, relearn. Progress was slow for obvious reasons, but that was to be expected in pursuit of such a difficult vision. That’s just how it was.

The problem was the problem. Paul realized that what we needed to be solved was not, in fact, human powered flight. That was a red-herring. The problem was the process itself, and along with it the blind pursuit of a goal without a deeper understanding how to tackle deeply difficult challenges. He came up with a new problem that he set out to solve: how can you build a plane that could be rebuilt in hours not months. And he did. He built a plane with Mylar, aluminum tubing, and wire.



The first airplane didn’t work. It was too flimsy. But, because the problem he set out to solve was creating a plane he could fix in hours, he was able to quickly iterate. Sometimes he would fly three or four different planes in a single day. The rebuild, retest, relearn cycle went from months and years to hours and days.

18 years had passed since Henry Kremer opened his wallet for his vision. Nobody could turn that vision into an airplane. Paul MacCready got involved and changed the understanding of the problem to be solved. Half a year later later, MacCready’s Gossamer Condor flew 2,172 meters to win the prize. A bit over a year after that, the Gossamer Albatross flew across the channel.

What’s the take-away? When you are solving a difficult problem re-ask the problem so that your solution helps you learn faster. Find a faster way to fail, recover, and try again. If the problem you are trying to solve involves creating a magnum opus, you are solving the wrong problem.

WHY YOU DON’T NEED DEVICE SPECIFIC BREAKPOINTS

BY JUSTIN AVERY, 28 OCT 2014 : OPINION

With the ever growing number of different mobile, tablet, laptops, monitors, televisions, watches — and whatever else will communicate information to you visually — it's finally time to put to rest those device specific breakpoints.

Recently I was fortunate to spend some time with Brad Frost. One of our conversations — most of which weren't anything to do with the industry — was around the need to upgrade to the latest round of devices (the iPhone 6 had recently been released).

I was joking about coming across my first iPad (2011 iPad 2) and how comically large it seemed after using the iPad Mini. With so many new devices that were now hitting the shelves and the fact that we're no longer wowed that there's a new bigger and skinnier phone has meant that for some the upgrade to the latest version isn't something that is as vital as it once was.

DESIRE TO UPGRADE

One of the reasons behind wanting to upgrade to the latest device was the need to start testing our own and our client websites to see what we needed to fix.

With the iPhone 6 new larger screen, and it's companions 6+ even bigger screen this would surely introduce a new set of design problems for all the sites we only launched since the iPhone 5 resize.

Surely this, along with the High DPI Screen was going to warrant us to head out and upgrade to the latest bit of hardware.

RESPONSIVE DESIGN AT ITS BEST

The fact is that we didn't need to do anything.

Nothing. Nada. Zip.

Over the past 4 years (that's right, the idea has been around for that long and it's not going anywhere) we've been moving towards a more responsive web. We have flexible grids, we have flexible images, and we use media queries to rearrange our layouts when the viewport dictates.

Over the 4 years we have slowly moved away from device specific breakpoints in favour of content specific breakpoints, i.e. adding a breakpoint when the content is no longer easy to consume.

With this fundamental shift in thinking we no longer have to fear a new device — a new iPhone width — because we've already fixed our sites to work everywhere.

Lets take a look at three of the most common issues with new widths and why they no longer matter.

FORM FACTOR

This is actually a good reason for testing. The size of the phone has increased and therefore the way we interface with the phone will change. Luke Wroblewski has written about the form factor and possible solutions to navigation.

This is nothing new though. There have been larger phones on the market since the Samsung Note was released so many of the issues faced will have already been overcome.

Apple have released a double tap on the home button to move the top of the screen closer for tapping elements, but this form factor is not available across all devices so not something that provides a well rounded solution.

Form factor doesn't matter because you've already taken these screen sizes into consideration with other devices.

HIGH DPI

When the retina display (Apples marketing name for high DPI screens) was released it caused a world wide panic. First there was 1.5 high dpi which meant you needed a 38px icon to render nice and crisp when displayed at 25px. Then we had the 2x icon sizes and we needed a 50px icon to render nice and crisp when displayed at 25px.

At some point we got bored or resizing icons and worked out that if we used Font Icons or SVG icons then it didn't matter how good the screen would become because the vector looks beautiful and crisp EVERYWHERE.

High DPI/Retina doesn't matter because you've already updated all your logo's and icons to SVG and that scales to work on any device.

NEW VIEWPORT DIMENSIONS

For a little while we lost site of what Responsive Design really meant — and I mean the underlying theory of Responsive Design where we respond our content to fit any viewport — and we began to use device widths to target particular layouts towards.

We knew that browser and device sniffing was frowned upon and thought that we could achieve the same approach using only media queries. This spurred the 320, 480, and 768px media queries that kept with the iPhone 3/4 and iPad viewport dimensions. When the iPhone 5 was released a handful of use updated the 480px query to 568px to accommodate the slightly larger screen. Strangely we never looked at Android phone dimensions (probably because there's far too many of them).

Fortunately at some point we all became aware we were doing it wrong and fell back to allowing the content dictate our breakpoints. This has the greatest benefit of all, the ability to still serve our sites content perfectly regardless of the device sizes released to market.

New device size don't matter because you've already based your media query breakpoints on the content.

THE FUTURE

This won't be the last iPhone to be released, and it certainly won't be the last smart phone released with a new dimension.

Fortunately it no longer matters the size of the devices that are coming in the future because we're already prepared for them with our flexible grids, flexible images, and content focussed breakpoints.

The picture proposal has meant that in the future image sizes are no longer an issue either, although we do need to become better at setting the sizes attribute.

The biggest issue we're going to have now will be producing content for smaller screens. Screens that fit on your wrist. This is a problem less for responsive design to solve, after all we can't reduce the content to less than a single column.

Instead the solution will be in the format we serve our content. Making it available not just in between <html>..</html> tags, but also in formats like <xml> <rss> and json.




04. The decline of the website

Have you noticed the gradual decline in the role of the website? Take for example going to see a movie. You know what you want to see, but you don’t know where it is showing.

In the past you would have visited each movie theatre website one at a time to see if they were showing the film you wanted. Each website was different, crafted by a busy team of web designers.

My betting is that is not how you look up movies anymore. The chances are you have a single app on your mobile that aggregates movie listings from many sources. Perhaps you even ask Siri or just Google it.

Web design trends for 2015
Who needs websites when you have Siri?
This creates a much better experience as users don't have to deal with different interfaces. Unfortunately it does start to undermine the role of the designer crafting these different sites.

I am sure it won't be long before you ask Siri and she tells you when and where your film is on. The whole thing done by voice command, no user interface at all.

Content is being set free from design. Instead we are sharing content via APIs between applications and sites. Sometimes business owners are choosing to put their content on Facebook, Yelp or Foursquare. They are abandoning the idea of having their own site. This is something that is particularly prevalent in China.

http://thetomorrowlab.com/2015/01/why-developers-hate-being-interrupted/

Interruptions are to developers what kryptonite is to Superman—they kill productivity and there’s a significant recovery period.

There are two types of interruption: the planned meeting and the one where someone walks over to your desk to talk to you (or if you’re unlucky enough to have a desk phone it’s when the phone rings). The random interruption is akin to walking up to a someone building a lego tower, kicking it over and expecting them to continue from where they were the moment before you arrived. The planned meeting is a lot longer and kills productivity before, not just during and after. So, there are two types of problem that need addressed here.

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A DEVELOPER IS INTERRUPTED?
A huge amount of what a developer is doing is in their head. As we write code we need to keep a mental model of how parts of the application that have already been written and are yet to be written interact with the part that we are writing at that moment. We need to have a solid picture of exactly how the code is working as a whole and maintain that picture. It’s not easy, it requires a lot of concentration and has to remain in place while we think of creative and efficient ways to solve the problem at hand.

Developers can appear very unproductive at times, sitting staring at the screen with our headphones on and very little in the way of keyboard clackety-tap. This however is when we are doing our thinking, when we are building up, adding to and rearranging the mental model of how our code will work. This is the biggest and hardest part of development.

Imagine how it feels to have that interrupted at random by a telephone call or somebody walking over to talk to you. It’s horrible.

This picture explains it very well.

The thing about this mental model is that it takes about an hour to build up from a cold start (first thing in the morning, after lunch or after a meeting). Thankfully that’s not the case after a five minute interruption from a boss or account manager. In that case it takes 10-15 minutes before a developer is back “in the zone” with a repaired mental model and ready to write some more code.

That’s still not great—we only need 4 or 5 small interruptions for an hour to be lost.

Scheduled meetings don’t bring the mental modal crashing down the way smaller interruptions do, but they have a significant impact. We know the meeting is taking place so we can stop where there’s a natural break point in our work and prepare for the meeting. Not such a huge problem there.

Where it becomes a problem is if the meeting is scheduled for an hour or so after lunch or arriving in the office. Remember that it takes about an hour to be in a position to write code after a longer break. Combine that with the fact that nobody can write much code in less than an hour, so anything that leaves a developer with less than two hours is probably going to mean it’s not worth the effort to get started only to stop and have to get started again afterwards.

There’s one more thing, a theory by developer come venture capitalist Paul Graham called Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule. In it Graham posits that managers are on a different schedule to makers and that is the root of the problem. Interruptions are the symptom.

It’s a good article and well worth reading. I feel it’s well summarised by two early paragraphs:

Most powerful people are on the manager’s schedule. It’s the schedule of command. But there’s another way of using time that’s common among people who make things, like programmers and writers. They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You can’t write or program well in units of an hour. That’s barely enough time to get started.

When you’re operating on the maker’s schedule, meetings are a disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in. Plus you have to remember to go to the meeting. That’s no problem for someone on the manager’s schedule. There’s always something coming on the next hour; the only question is what. But when someone on the maker’s schedule has a meeting, they have to think about it.

The upshot of all of this is that developers often end up working late at night when there is no chance of an interruption and we know we can really get stuck into a project. Obviously this is not ideal. Developers are no more able to cope with a lack of sleep than anyone else, especially as we get past our twenties.

REDUCING INTERRUPTIONS
So what practical measures can we take to alleviate this?

Toby Osbourn has written a fantastic article on the subject of small interruptions and one of the things he highlights is the need for developers to turn off the interruptions we create ourselves like having our phone on a stand under our monitor, distracting us with every text, call, tweet and whatever other notifications it has turned on.

Desktop notifications need to go too. Close that email client and get rid of any browser tabs that aren’t related to the task in hand.

Here at The Tomorrow Lab we have a headphones rule. If a developer has headphones on or in both ears they cannot be disturbed. If only one ear has music then they can be disturbed about work. It’s been in place for a good while but for 2015 we decided to formalise it in the form of a poster on the wall, and you can download it to print if you like!

Another thing Osbourn suggests is moving somewhere else such as a coffee shop or working from home. Thankfully here at The Tomorrow Lab we can work from home frequently but moving out of the office is not something that would work for us over extended periods of time. There’s a lot of collaborative work with other members of the team on design, digital marketing, sales and with each other that we need to be in the office for.

The key thing for me though is communication with interrupters. They will never know how they affect our productivity unless we tell them. They spend all day doing their job and aren’t going to find out via telepathy that what they are doing is having a negative influence on how we do ours. Another system we are prototyping here is a timetable or quota of time when everybody has to stay away from developers unless there is a serious problem with a live site. We can’t impose this on account managers and directors so we need to work with them, effectively communicating why such a system needs to be in place and how it benefits the whole company.

That’s all fine for small interruptions, what about planned meetings? We can’t just take a laptop to a coffee shop to avoid meetings we’re supposed to be at. Meetings are a necessary evil. (Granted they are usually last twice as long as they need to which is a separate issue.)

To be honest we’re not sure the best way to tackle this one. We conducted an internal survey asking 4 questions:

What time(s) of day do you feel most productive?
What time(s) of day would you rather have meetings at?
What/who are the worst interruptions you have to deal with?
Anything else you want to say on the subject of being interrupted?
The initial feedback would suggest we’re not going to keep everyone happy when scheduling meetings but there are some “hotspot” times i.e. times you don’t dare touch when organsing a meeting. These hotspot times are in addition to the first couple of hours in the morning and after lunch. On top of that we aren’t robots working in The Tomorrow Lab so we each have different start times and lunch times.

I think the best we can hope for is that nobody ends up feeling like they’re always in meetings right when they are most likely to solve a hard problem.

HOW TO DEAL WITH INTERRUPTIONS WHEN THEY HAPPEN
We’re talking about short interruptions here, the unplanned type. They will happen—hopefully less than before—but they will happen, and the aim when dealing with them is to preserve the structural integrity of the mental model as much as possible.

First of all split up the main problem into a list of smaller tasks, so instead of thinking something like, “Now where was I with the progressively enhanced accessible modal dialogue”, it’s more like, “Now where was I with updating the aria-hidden attribute”.

Secondly learn how to answer the interrupter with something polite along the lines of, “I can’t look at it right now, send me an email to remind me and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.” People will soon learn there’s not much point in interrupting you when they’ll just be going back to their desk to type out the same thing they were trying to tell you.

SUMMARY
Interruptions are a serious problem, they cause a huge amount in lost productivity, ergo money, and can make it very hard to get anything done. Working in a company where interruptions are guaranteed and nothing can be done about it is very demoralising. On the other hand, working in a company (*cough* like Tomorrow Lab *cough*) where you’re left to get on with your work is fantastic. It makes a developer feel like they can achieve something, it makes us look forward to going into work, it makes us feel fulfilled at the end of each day.

Developers don’t wear headphones because we enjoy music more than anyone else, it’s because headphones shut everything out and give us the mental space we need to build a very complicated model. (A lot of us view open plan offices as the worst invention of the 20th century!)

If you’re an interrupter and you get a terser response than you might have expected please don’t take it personally. We’re just aware of the model starting to loosen at the more precarious points and are getting frantic about the need to get back at work.

If you’re a developer and you’ve discovered some novel or interesting ways to reduce and/or deal with interruptions, please let us know in the comments.


http://sixrevisions.com/git/why-you-should-use-git/

Ever since version control systems such as Git have become widely-known and well-used, modern development processes have radically changed.

Here are some reasons why Git has the power to improve your development workflow.


Git Encourages Modularization
In even the smallest development projects, developers are often required to work on multiple components in parallel. Feature X, bug #102, a new UI for a sign-up form, etc.

Among many others, here are a couple of major issues with projects that aren’t version-controlled:

Project dependencies will be painful to manage. Team members must sort out which changes affect which components.
Unfinished and experimental code will mix-in with production-ready code. Without version control, there is a huge chance that an unstable piece of code gets deployed to a production environment.
Imagine these scenarios.

Your client tells you that they don’t want feature X anymore.

Or what if you find that feature Y — an experimental feature you have been working on — can’t be implemented?

How do you get code removed safely from your code base?

Using branches is the solution to these commonplace development problems. Although Git wasn’t the version control system (VCS) that introduced the concept of branching, it’s the first of its kind that makes it user-friendly.

Git Encourages Creativity and Experimentation
Git branching will improve your code-quality and productivity. It facilitates creativity and experimentation by removing your fear that the current version of the project will be affected while you are trying out ideas, giving you an environment where you can confidently explore and develop your project’s future features.

With Git, you can even create multiple branches that approach a given problem in different ways, test each of them with your master branch (the most current version of your project), and then choose the best option.

Git Allows You to Undo Your Mistakes
In Git, you can undo almost everything.

Being able to undo things gives your team the courage to try out ideas and concepts without the risk of breaking stuff, which in turn fosters a culture of innovation.

Git Makes Your Progress Clear
A commit in Git refers to the act of recording changes you have made in your source code.

When used properly, Git makes it easy to craft very granular commits. You can see what changes have occurred down to the microscopic level: Git will tell you what characters and lines in your source code have been altered. If you want to compare two versions of a file or the difference between two of your commits, you can issue Git’s diff command, which will highlight the differences between them.

A side note when using commits: As a good version control policy, I recommend that each commit should only contain changes that belong to a single topic.

For instance, if you’re fixing a specific bug — let’s call it bug #200 — that requires multiple source code changes across several files, all those changes should be under one commit in order for you to easily track changes to your project related to that bug. This way, you can document that "commit X fixed bug #200". A side benefit of this commit policy is, when you encounter another bug similar to bug #200 somewhere else in your project months from now, you can review how you resolved the first bug.

Mixing different topics in one commit makes it hard to see what things were added or resolved.

Also, multi-topic commits makes it more difficult to roll back to a previous version if you ever find the need to do so. Imagine a commit that contains changes for both feature A and feature B. If you find out later on that you introduced a severe security leak with feature B, you’ll have to roll back the code for both topics just to get rid of the problem.

You Can Work Offline
A lot of companies underestimate the benefits that can be had if their developers were to be able to work offline.

Being able to code on your laptop without having to connect to your company’s servers is not only about being able to work during a commute or while at home (which a lot of companies don’t permit due to security restrictions).

More importantly, being able to work offline makes you more fail-safe as a team: While with a VCS like Subversion or CVS, a developer can’t continue their work when a central server goes down, this is not an issue with Git.

In Git, developers can perform everything on their personal computer, making them independent of possible infrastructure downtimes.

Never Lose Data Ever Again
Losing data and not being able to recover it can break a dev project.

We’ve all heard or experienced our own set of horror stories about failed backups and servers. It’s good to know that when using Git, every developer working on a project has a full-fledged copy on their machine, including the project’s complete change history.

And if your team uses a remote source code repository such as GitHub, then the chances of losing your work in the event that your on-site backups fail is much smaller.

If your backups break down, losing data isn’t even a possibility when using Git: Just take any team member’s local repository and restore in minutes.

How to Use Git Today
Git has stepped out of being a technology for early-adopters. Today, more and more developers are using it to improve the quality of their code and workflow.
