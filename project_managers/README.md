# Project Managers

Your role is the most important. You are responsible for making sure the rest of the production team can do their jobs smoothly, for making sure the project actually gets produced, and produced to the best of your team's abilities. You are the enabler. You control chaos with a strong determined smile and a tenacious attitude that means stuff can get done. You're also squeezed in the middle of various departments and levels of seniority, being pulled in different directions, into different environments, despite everyone working towards the same goal - the project being delivered successfully. So yeah... it's stressful... but it can also reward you with the greatest sense of accomplishment as you know more than anyone how much work has gone into putting the project together. Many people fail to apprecuate just how many hats you have to wear or what skill it takes to accomplish your role.

As a web project manager both the client and your team will look to you to be the fountain of knowledge, give them direction, help resolve problems and make sure everything runs smoothly by being the dependable rock when everyone else is cracking around you.

In my experience, by consistently displaying a high degree of honesty, trust and integrity to everyone throughout the web project’s entire lifecycle helps improve your chances of success, cements your position as a solid leader and earns you respect from both client and project team alike.

A relationship that is based on honesty and trust with staff should create an environment of mutual respect. This environment should produce a more efficient production environment where staff are willing to go the extra mile to deliver a truly excellent product.
Ed Richardson, Honesty is the best policy.

HONESTY AND TRUST IN WEB PROJECTS
Of the many things you can be sure of when running any web project, one of them is that at some point you will have the choice to be honest or not so honest with either the client or your team. This choice is only ever one that takes more than a minute to debate in your Web Project Manager brain when the truth is likely to upset someone.

These choices come in all sorts of shapes and sizes but invariably include:

Explaining to the client why a deliverable is late
Telling a team member their work isn’t up to scratch
Admitting you made a mistake yourself
In each instance the temptation for most Web Project Managers, in fact all human beings, is to at least consider taking the easy route and delivering a distorted version of the truth, or in non-corporate buzzword bingo professional terms – lying.

The fact of the matter is, often not being honest is the easiest option and will immediately make everyone feel great, however it’s pretty rare for this short-term easy option not to come back and bite you right on the backside and this is far more damaging to a relationship with the client or project team in the long run.

As a Web Project Manager, by cultivating a reputation as an honest straight talking person who will always tell you the truth, no matter how bad the truth is, eventually results in most trusting you when you speak – in business no one wants to have the wool pulled over their eyes and most can spot it a mile off.

So the next time a client demands to know why the deliverable is late when the reason will make you or your agency look less than great, tell them the truth… It will hurt, it will sting and it will be an awkward conversation that you’ll want to end, but, in most cases once the anger has faded away the client will almost always respect you for having the balls to be honest when other weaker web project managers would’ve lied.

The key lesson is that once a client knows you have the courage to be honest with them when it’s really bad news, they’ll completely trust you to always be honest from that point on and trust pretty much everything you say which, over the course of a project lasting months or years, is an invaluable position to be in as opposed to the oh so common vague feeling of mistrust that often exists between client and web agency.

INTEGRITY IN WEB PROJECT MANAGEMENT
Defined by the English dictionary as “Steadfast adherence to a strict moral or ethical code”, integrity is something a Web Project Manager needs time to develop and demonstrate, but once you have established yourself to the client and your web team as a leader with a great deal of integrity you will find all your working relationships improve dramatically.

Although inextricably linked with honesty and trust, integrity in web projects is all about acting in the most professional manner possible in front of your client or web team when faced with situations that require you to choose between standing by your principles, or, forgetting you have any for fear of appearing to be going against the grain.

Sometimes telling the truth will not make people happy, or make you the winner of a popularity contest. In some cases you may suffer from “loss of grace” for telling the truth or for standing up for what is right.
Thomas M. Cunningham, US Naval Academy Fire Department, Leadership 101: Integrity.

Examples of displaying integrity in a web project management role include:

Accepting responsibility for a mistake that you or one of your project team made
Openly defending a project team member or client when the temptation is to keep quiet
Insisting quality standards remain despite the temptation to cut corners
Preceding each of the above examples comes a situation where as a Web Project Manager you will have a choice between staying quiet and letting someone else take the fall or, as Thomas Cunningham puts it, standing up for what is right.

In these instances it is you that may be hurt and stung by the response, but as with honesty, over time your team and client will respect you for choosing to take this position as your default one.

As a Web Project Manager, failure to act with honesty and integrity will undoubtedly be your undoing. Both clients and your web project team will at some point become very wise to the fact you are keeping quiet, blaming others and treat you accordingly – with mistrust – and there is nothing more damaging to a project.

Having the strength to take a few hits for your web project team or from angry clients on the phone is not easy. It will often feel like you’re getting a load of flak and stress that you really don’t need and know full well you don’t deserve, but, the trust and respect you win from the people that matter is infinitely more valuable to your projects when compared to the reputation you pick up from acting inappropriately.

If you are in a web project management position, or any other leadership or management position for that matter, I cannot recommend reading the Leadership 101: Integrity article enough – it has absolutely nothing to do with web projects but everything to do with what it means to be a great leader. If you can manage to apply even one part of it in your day job, you will be a better leader and manager for it!

peaking to a web designer friend recently, the conversation naturally turned to work and I heard something for what must be the gazillionth time from so many web designers and developers…

The Web Project Managers and Digital Account Managers at my place are so shit!

Of course I enquire why and invariably end up hearing the same reason – that they seem to just say yes to all client requests and push them downhill to the teams doing the work, by which point it’s usually too late to say no.

As much as I want to defend all Web Project Managers out there and the tough job you do, the truth is I’ve seen this myself and it seriously pissed me off too.

STOP SAYING YES TO EVERYTHING DOUCHE
Newsflash – you’re allowed to say no to clients. Maybe you can’t say it as directly as that, but you don’t have to do everything they ask, even when they ask hard.

A photo of a staged interrogation scene with one man holding a box to the face of a man while another holds the head of the man who looks distressedYou WILL launch on Friday at 5pm or your conkers will end up in here!
If you know what a client is asking you to do is silly, in my opinion, they’re paying you to tell them that, even when they don’t want to be told and even if after you tell them they get a little annoyed. It’s your job to protect the client from being silly and sometimes that means saying no when it’s going to mean pain for you.

I’m not so naive that I don’t fully appreciate the times when you have to give in, I’ll come onto that later, but there are so many instances where I’ve seen a Web Project Manager or Account Manager agree to a silly client request when I’m sure it’s only because of one of the following reasons:

They don’t have enough knowledge to have enough confidence to challenge the request and suggest an alternative.
They don’t have the courage to challenge the client.
They’re selfish, don’t care about the project or team and just want an easy life.
Just no.

Please, if this is you, I know it’s unlikely you’ll ever admit it to anyone, but that’s ok. All I ask is that you do something about it because chances are you’re providing a shoddy service to your client and causing your own colleagues a lot of pain and stress.

If you don’t have enough digital knowledge to recognise a silly request and thus the confidence to challenge it and provide an alternative, start admitting this to your team. It’s absolutely fine to ‘not know’ as long as you’re willing to learn. I’ve seen rookie Junior Web Project Managers transform into kick ass fully fledged PMs simply by asking questions and having the hunger to learn. If you don’t want to or can’t be bothered to learn, please leave our profession.

If you’re able to recognise a silly request but are just flat out scared to challenge the client, fear not, this is normal. However you have to overcome that fear, remember that your job is to provide expert consultation to the client and loyalty and dedication to your agency and team. It’s ok to be scared, but push through it for the client, your team and yourself.

If you’re that kind of selfish Web Project Manager or Account Manager that just doesn’t care about anything but your pay check and home time while ensuring you appear brilliant to your boss, just piss off, I can’t help you, but be aware that 90% of the people around you see through you completely and think you’re shit.

EMPATHISE WITH YOUR TEAM
As a non-shit Web Project Manager you’ll know that sometimes, no matter how hard you try, the client wins and you have to swallow your pride and say yes to a silly request, and boy is that a long depressing walk to your team’s desk to give them the news.



One of the most valuable skills in a Web Project Manager’s set is empathy. Without it you can’t understand clients, what they want, why they want it, your boss, your colleagues – nothing – and when you have to tell your team to execute a silly request – empathy is vital.

Thus, when you have to give that awful news to your team, first understand that it’s a horrid request that’s likely to piss them off. Then appreciate that being pissed off is actually a pretty strong emotional reaction that means they actually care about what they do, a lot.

Think about it, on the surface it sounds like every Web Project Manager’s dream that a team would just accept all of their decisions without fuss and do the work requested, but that would actually be horrible.

That would mean you have soulless robots working for you and who on earth wants that? Not me. What innovation are robots like that going to produce? None. Will these robots ever do work that blows yours and your client’s socks off? I very much doubt it.

Recognise your team’s frustration as passion, embrace it and use it.

(Unless they’re being a bit of a dick of course. This happens sometimes too.)

RESPECT YOUR TEAM
An attitude I often see in shit Web Project Managers and Account Managers is potentially the most damaging one and that is when they don’t respect their teams.

It sounds bizarre, but if you’ve been around long enough I’m sure you will have encountered this awful attitude. In the context of this article, this disrespectful attitude manifests itself as giving teams silly requests to do with next to no explanation whatsoever in the belief that ‘they wouldn’t care’ or much worse ‘wouldn’t understand’ ARRRRRRRGH!!!! I hate this so much I want to kill!

A phot of a cat hissing in anger.Screw you shit Web Project Manager. See my hiss!
Guess what shitty Web PMs and AMs, web designers and developers are very smart people and will definitely understand, IF you bother to respect them enough to take the time and explain it.

Seriously, I’ve lost count of the amount of times I’ve had to give what appears to be a silly request to a team and been met with resistance and frustration, but each time I’m fully aware that it appears shit, but also take the time to explain why I’ve accepted the decision and am thus passing the request on – this always seems appreciated by the team and leaves things with a nice vibe rather than a crappy one.

The fact of the matter is, if I’m passing on a silly request then there is probably some very good underlying commercial reason behind it that I believe makes it the right decision. If I explain the the history of that decision along with that commercial rationale, then the same smart people I’m asking to execute the request will hopefully realise that they too would make the same decision in my shoes – job done.

Shit Web Project Managers, please stop being so shit. Cheers.



### Getting things done

16 MINUTES AS A WEB PROJECT MANAGER
You arrive at the office at 9am with your day mapped out; you finish your coffee, catch up on a few RSS feeds and prepare to start your scheduled work feeling at one with the world. It’s now 9.16am. If you’ve received ten e-mails, two client phone calls, a good new business lead and have before you a design and development team that need briefing in order to start work – all that demand immediate attention that supersede your scheduled work…

Chances are you’re a Web Project Manager and it’s a normal day at the office.

WHY DIDN’T I TAKE THE BLUE PILL?
Right about now you wonder why you ever made the switch from web developer to project manager…

Moving from web development to web project management is a long and difficult journey. One of the biggest challenges along the way is learning how to deal with approximately one trillion things each day, very approximately.

No two web agencies are the same and no two projects the same, but somehow you have to find a way to stay on top of things before you fall down in a crumpled heap begging for mercy. Getting Things Done, or GTD as it’s known to fellow cult members, is what personally saved me, and can save you, from becoming this broken down sorry excuse for a web project manager.

GETTING THINGS DONE (GTD)
Founded by David Allen and introduced to me by a good friend, and web guru, Branden Faulls, GTD is a system that is accompanied by the tagline “The Art of Stress Free Productivity” and while I can’t proclaim to now be stress free, I am certainly less stressed, a lot more organised and am able to deal with a great deal more than I could before adopting this system.

I won’t attempt to describe in detail what GTD is as it’s a huge topic, if you want to read more your best bet is to buy the book from Amazon or download the audio book from Audible, my personal preference. What I want to discuss here is the parts of GTD I use on a daily basis that enable me to do my day-to-day web project management job.

NEXT ACTIONS, WAITING FOR AND INBOX ZERO
The primary concepts I use from GTD are ‘Next Actions’ and ‘Waiting For’ items. By using just these two GTD principles, of which there are many more, I am able to make sure I never forget to complete a task no matter how many other actions I have, how long it has been since it last entered my head or how small it is when compared to the larger issues at hand. Best of all it results in regularly achieving, on a daily basis, having no e-mails in my inbox, known in GTD circles as ‘Inbox Zero’ – this alone is guaranteed to reduce your stress levels! To learn more about Inbox Zero check out Merlin Mann’s excellent talk at Google in 2007.



So, how exactly to apply these principles to my working day, it’s pretty simple really, however don’t let the simplicity lure you into thinking this happened overnight without many different attempts and approaches to implement it. It really is about trial and error, what took months to devise and get working for me at my last company completely fell over when I joined my current company Rawnet, but the overriding principles are always the same.

Using the very real scenario in the opening paragraph let me explain how GTD enables me to capture and action everything…

PROCESSING E-MAIL TO INBOX ZERO
I will quickly scan all ten e-mails, looking to identify if any of them require me to do something or not, or if it was a piece of information I was waiting for:

If it contains something I have to do, I will open up my Backpack list and under the Next Actions list I will prefix the ‘to do’ with a project identifier and add the action (you’d be surprised how often a huge e-mail can be digested with and result in a one line action item). I’ll then drag this e-mail to the project folder in my e-mail client and move onto the next
If an e-mail contains no next action and no waiting for I will simply digest and drag to the project’s folder
If an e-mail contains something I was waiting for from someone, I will locate this in my Waiting For list in Backpack and edit the item specifying the Next Action that I can now complete having got the information I needed and drag the item from the Waiting For list into the Next Actions list
If a Waiting For item means I can quickly send off another e-mail in response that will move the project forward in two minutes, I will do so, regardless of the other high-priority things I need to do. If you can move a project forward with one quick e-mail that will no doubt take someone a while to reply to, just do it rather than capture the fact you need to! Once sent, I’ll add a new Waiting For that will remind me that I need an answer in order to progress the project
If the Waiting For signals the end of a task and requires no Next Action I will just tick the item forever banishing it to the completed list
The end result is all e-mails are moved out of my inbox and to the relevant project folder with all Next Actions and Waiting For items captured in my centralised master Backpack list – I then await the inevitable wave of euphoria at seeing the “No messages in your inbox” message, ahhhhh.

But wait, a client’s on the phone wanting to talk about their project, now what!?

UNEXPECTED CLIENT PHONE CALLS
Out of nowhere, and before you know it, the handset is pressed to your ear and you await the unknown that is the unexpected client phone call. With baited breath you await the first question, is it a huge content delay, a 180° shift in design brief or a new piece of functionality needed? Hoorah, it’s not a big one, the client is simply asking you what dimensions the hero banner will be on the homepage and if you could possibly give their technical lead a call to discuss the required hosting configuration.

What the client doesn’t know however is that the minute the phone rang, I had clicked my magic Backpack shortcut and opened my master list – while the client talks I am immediately adding Next Actions to my list, but wait, why not take advantage of this unexpected call to close off some vital issues needed to move the project forward! With a quick scan of all Waiting For items I spot three things I need from this client in order to move other phases forward, I proceed to enquire after all three and manage to get answers on two, perfect! I tick them off or change them to Next Actions and hey presto, project moved forward.

This technique, and world-class Backpack quick draw speeds, allows me to:

Fully concentrate on the call and the client (a client knows and doesn’t like when you’re distant or sound unsure of all of your Next Actions or Waiting For items for their project)
Instantly and digitally capture all that the client wants without having to scribble notes I realise later I can’t read before deciphering and re-typing into a digital format, taking twice the time
Close off outstanding issues on the spot without having to flip through a notebook looking for more illegible notes I made three weeks ago
Being able to quickly and accurately, take client requests on board, get key information from them at the drop of the hat while being able to recite all of the Next Actions you have planned for their project makes you a more efficient web project manager and the client feel confident that you are on top of their project which equals client love, and let’s face it, that’s the love we crave isn’t it!?

Although all of this sounds like a complete pain to implement, after a few days it really becomes second nature and takes just a few minutes out of your day, but boy are they minutes well spent.

HOWEVER, THE IDEAL SOLUTION ELUDES ME
Although my personal GTD inspired processes have helped me a great deal, they are by no means perfect. For instance Backpack has no way of allowing you to add deadline dates to Next Actions or Waiting For items, you can’t prioritise items in any more a sophisticated way than order by most important, not ideal.

EDIT: In the sequel to this article, GTD for Web Project Management Revisted – Tracks and GTDify, I take you through my current GTD weapon of choice that is far better than Backpack and has kept me in GTD heaven for the last few months; Tracks and GTDify!

FREE GTD TOOLS I RECOMMEND
Trust me I’ve tried most of them! The following tools are the ones that stand out as having a good balance of portability and ease of use when trying to implement the GTD basics:

GTD For Web Project Managament – Revisited: The sequel to this article
Things: Mac/iPhone only, but very highly regarded
Tracks: Ruby and web-based tool, initial testing is very positive indeed!
Backpack: 37Signals web-based tool, excellent for more than just basic GTD
GTD Gmail: Great tool for those who process work e-mail using Gmail
DEVELOP YOUR OWN GTD-BASED PROCESSES
As anyone who knows about GTD will tell you, the processes I use only make up about 5% of the entire GTD blueprint and even then don’t really follow the teachings to the letter, but they work for me at this time and at this company. I would urge all of you to try and develop your own processes based on the Next Actions and Waiting For items principles and see for yourself how organised you suddenly feel.

- stress sponge

- stay positive

ime and time again I read about the importance and power of being positive when it comes to not only work, but life as well. They essentially preach that if you stay positive during a challenging time then it’s more likely to yield a positive result, and conversely, if you take a negative viewpoint the chances of failure are maximised.

A photograph of a vast American desert landscape with huge mountains and boulders with super imposed words reading Big Possibilities Await YouWhat’s more annoying, the crap cliché or font style and position?
While I’m not going to dispute this, I do feel this life lesson is often misunderstood and even abused in the workplace with the result being failure in the short-term, and in the long-term a very damaging self-perpetuating culture that actually hinders businesses everywhere by scaring employees into silence and creating a delusional mindset – or as described in the fascinating article by Jason Yip.

…a systemic inability to confront brutal reality.
Why does problem-hiding occur? Jason Yip

To bring it back to a web project management level, I’m talking about a situation where a client or your colleagues give you what looks like an impossible web project-based mountain to climb and when you begin to raise anything other than positive sugar coated comments you’re labelled as being negative.



I’ll say it now – I think this is utter BULLSHIT.

But hang on a minute, how do you know you’re not being negative? How do you know what’s being asked of you and your team is not feasible? How do you know by immediately taking this approach isn’t dooming the challenge to failure before you’ve even tried?

NEGATIVITY EXPLORED
The dictionary describes ‘negativity’ as:

Expressing, containing, or consisting of a negation, refusal, or denial – indicating opposition or resistance. Lacking positive or constructive features, unpleasant, disagreeable, gloomy, pessimistic.
The Free Dictionary

Pretty depressing huh, kind of makes you feel like the below made me feel as a child, FIGHT AGAINST THE SADNESS!



Horrific! If you want to take a few minutes to recover at this point I completely understand.

However when it comes to web project management I sincerely believe it is a Web Project Manager’s job to execute most of the actions listed in the first sentence of the dictionary’s definition when necessary, and absolutely at all costs never any of those in the second – thus throwing the very essence of ‘what is negativity’ in web projects into a spin.

It’s my belief that there are two types of people labelled as negative in digital agencies:

A person who’s never positive about any web project or agency strategies
A person who’s realistic and isn’t afraid to speak up while others are afraid
A photograph of a ginger coloured cat sat down looking extremely grumpyA feline representation of a Type 1
For the purposes of this article I’m going to ignore the Type 1 people and leave them with their dehumanised droid-esque title but want to emphasis just how different these two types are.

THE DANGERS OF BLIND POSITIVE THINKING
Before I get into why negativity isn’t always bad, let’s look at the benefits of blind positive thinking. I use this term to refer to the mentality adopted by some whereby no matter what the challenge they believe simply by being positive means they will prevail – an attitude commonly associated with entrepreneurs.

There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that adopting this mindset will see both you and teams working for you through tough times. It is infinitely nicer to work in an environment where everyone is positive rather than negative, it motivates people, it encourages people to excel beyond their previously self-imposed limits and, just like negativity it’s highly infectious.

But, and it’s a big but, at what point does positivity drift into the delusional? I’ll tell you when, it’s at the point where no amount of positive thinking in the whole wide world will revert a doomed situation into a successful one.

To focus 100% on positivity, to try to trick your brain into thinking everything is great, is to prevent yourself from making an impact in your life and in the world. When you turn a blind eye to what’s wrong in the world and what’s wrong in your life, you’ll never be able to do anything to fix it.
Joey Weber, The Case for Being Negative

Positive thinking will not fill your tank with gas when you’ve run out, nor will it get your £100k web project complete for £10k – in steps the realist – or in the context of this article, the Web Project Manager.

A cartoon style illustration of a man in a homemade superhero cape running towards a cliff shouting I am thinking SUPER-POSITIVELY with a footnote narrative saying Moments before tragedy struckWeeeeeee… donk!
There will be points in a Web Project Manager’s career where they have to be the ones to put a total shitter on everyone’s ‘positive’ plans by getting annoying logical on their ass, some will call this being negative, but it isn’t, it’s just fact.

Sometimes you have to ram home the dangers of blind positive thinking and stop people making huge mistakes on web projects, but the method you choose to do this can seriously make or break your reputation as a Web Project Manager – play it wrong and you’ll be labelled as negative and future sceptical stands will be ignored, play it right and over time your judgment will be trusted.

THE CONFESSION
As with any lesson in web project management I’ve ever learnt, I learnt it the hard way, by making mistake after mistake. For example, when being given completely unrealistic budgets or deadlines I’ve made a ‘you must be mental‘ face and pretty much said that.

I was told to stop being so negative and to get on running the web project. I ran it to the best of my ability and of course it ran massively over schedule and budget. Was I right 99% of the time? You bet your sweet ass I was, but had I played this situation well? Hell no.

What I had done was de-motivate my boss, my team, myself and spent the whole project uttering bad things and occasionally getting accused of actually causing the overrun due to my negativity – total nonsense but also a total fail on my part.

So what exactly did these painful lessons teach me… they taught me how to communicate realism.

HOW TO BE NEGATIVE (REALISTIC)
Below are the lessons I’ve learnt when it comes to expressing huge concerns about web projects. If only one or two Web Project Managers out there can put these into practice and save themselves from some pain, I’ll be a happy little Englishman.

IT’S NOT OBVIOUS TO EVERYONE
First of all, when I was pulling my ‘you must be mental’ face I was making the mistake of assuming that the ‘mission impossible demand’ was so obviously unachievable only a fool could think otherwise.

Later I realised this is not the case and that was actually my experience managing web projects that meant I could see it immediately from a proposal, an estimate or proposed timeline, where others could not.

Think Before You Speak

Before you pull your version of ‘the face’ take a few minutes to consider the very real possibility that it’s not common sense but actually your skill, your expertise and the very reason they hired you that make it so clear to see – even if you’re completely right, holding back from reacting quickly will save you oodles of pain.

IGNORE YOUR INSTINCT, MAYBE IT’S POSSIBLE
Instead of immediately going toe-to-toe with a positive smiley person and ruin their mood and your reputation, start by being humble and consider the fact that your instincts may be wrong.

Approach the problem logically i.e. take all of the requirements, break them down into smaller chunks and assign money, time or people to it on the absolute happy path where there is zero resistance and see if in fact you’re right.

Try your damndest to make it work on paper, and only when you’ve sincerely tried every trick in the web project management book and still you find gaping holes can you start to take the next steps.

DON’T USE YOUR OPINION, USE COLD HARD NUMBERS
Once you’ve done all the calculations for the happy path, save it and format it in such a way that it cannot be disputed by anyone regardless of their sunny disposition. Although taking longer, this is the maths equivalent of the ‘are you mental’ face and is much more powerful, unless you’re Chuck Norris.

OFFER A REAL SOLUTION, AND GET POSITIVE!
This is one of the most important lessons in web project management, if not life… if you flat out disagree with something, don’t waste the limited time you have on this planet whining about it unless you’re willing to try and fix it.

As a Web Project Manager it’s your job to solve problems just as much as it is a designer’s or developer’s job.

Always follow the unveiling of your dream crushing numbers with either a proposed solution or a forum where a solution can be derived. Be it by adding more resource to a web project, using clever workarounds to achieve the same goals, getting more money or phasing the solution.

But don’t stop there, do the numbers on this too. Get the web project into a position where, even if it’s still going to be a mission, everyone, including you is able to get genuinely positive about it again!

THE CRUX OF THE MATTER
Anyone who hides behind the mask of eternal and permanent positivity claiming that anyone who protests are all negative, aside from getting right on my tits, need a swift kick up the behind.

There is a very real difference between being negative and being realistic.

A negative person is rarely positive, a realistic person is sometimes positive and sometimes not, but when not, always tries to get things into a state where they can feel positive about it as opposed to constantly ‘thinking positive’ and screwing up time and time again.

Being realistic does not mean limiting your dreams; it simply means you make sensible steps to reaching them.

- what you'll need and work towards

1. A SOLID PRE-SALES PROCESS
So a brand new web project is heading your way, it sounds awesome; you’re excited and can’t wait to get your teeth into it. You begin to the review all of the pre-sales documentation with the intention of beginning to plan the web project.

As you start to break down the project into tasks and allocate time, your web project management instinct and experience kicks in as the horrid reality dawns on you that the deliverables are ambiguous and what’s been sold looks unrealistic for the time and budget, and at this finite moment in time, you’re the only one that realises it – you bow your head and weep like a little girl.

An image of a web project manager fallen face first off his chair onto the floor.Web Project Managers are masters at subtle body language
Inheriting a web project with these kinds of issues puts the Web Project Manager in a very tricky situation from the start where one of the first actions is to start to push the client back on things and re-define project scope. This immediately affects how the client feels about you and makes trust that much harder to gain – trust from a client being one of the most important factors in web project success and is always formed most strongly at the beginning of a business relationship.

When I hear of this situation arising it reminds me of an article by Rob Borley called Under Sell and Over Deliver. The article title pretty much says it all and I’m sure it’s the dream of all the Web Project Managers out there, much more so than a pay rise.

HAVE A WHINGE, THEN TRY TO FIX THE PROBLEM
However, if you’re finding yourself in this position more and more, rather than bitch and moan (well, at least after bitching and moaning) I would suggest you try doing something to help resolve the situation, for example:

Speak to the people selling web projects and explain what the problem is and the position it puts you and the agency in
Try to get involved in the pre-sales process so you can identify potential issues early on
Track all project actual vs. actual times so you can give average percentages for project phases (handy when sales people know the budget they have to work with)
Involve the sales people in parts of projects so they can understand what they’re selling a little more
Have a major hissy fit at whoever sold the project until they burst into tears
Too often do I hear of people complaining about elements of their job yet they consistently choose to do nothing constructive to try and resolve the situation – to me this is just gutless whining and I have no time for it.

If you have a problem, raise it with the relevant people in a professional manner and try to suggest solutions, in most cases the recipient will be understanding and take your comments on board for next time – and if they don’t, proceed to Step 5.

2. ADEQUATE TIME TO MANAGE PROJECTS
Web project management takes time and there is nothing worse than being forced to manage web projects without enough time to perform even the basic project management necessities e.g. regular monitoring of budgets, schedules and tasks all the way through the lifecycle – but, how much time should a web project manager need per project? 10%, 15%, 20% of the project?

How much time a web project manager needs is very much a ‘how long is a piece of string’ question given how different web projects can be, some are simple and take little time, some are little but have a difficult client and thus take a long time, and others are tantamount to delivering the Death Star project before the Ewoks have a chance to help destroy it.

I read a blog post a while back (but typically can’t find it now) that stated because there is no way to determine how much time should be spent managing web projects, the only real way to know is to analyse your own time and if you’re finding you don’t have enough time to do the following on a daily basis then you are not being given enough time to effectively manage web projects:

Review all budgets
Review all progress against schedules
Redefine all tasks completed and left outstanding
Revise all budgets and schedules accordingly
Update the client
A common cause for project management overload isn’t in fact that you have too many projects on the go, but you have too many at a similar phase at the same time. As Brad Egeland puts it…

Having your project life cycles staggered is definitely one key to sanity and greatly increases your chances of success. One cannot sanely go through life managing 5 projects that are at the same point in their project life cycles at the same time. The demands on the project manager vary by phase.
Brad Egeland, Managing Multiple Projects – Stagger the Lifecycles

However, it could be argued that you’re not finding the time to do these things because you’re working inefficiently, but if you know you’re a competent web project manager and have the trust of your boss, this workload analysis holds true and you should raise it with them and hope for understanding and support.

If you don’t raise it as soon as you feel you’re not getting enough time to manage a web project, the likelihood is that you will probably lose control of the project and the risk of it being over budget, late or of low quality is increased significantly. It will often also result in you getting a smacked bum when perhaps it isn’t fully deserved, and that sucks donkey balls.

A happy web project manager is one that feels they have enough time to manage all the projects on their list in the right way. As with web designers and developers, if we have enough time to do our jobs properly we feel more confident of delivering high quality projects and that’s what makes us happy much more than money.

3. TRUST FROM YOUR BOSS
Trust is important to every Web Project Manager out there and is a key component in web project management. Trust from your client and your production team, or lack of, can seriously affect the result of any web project.

I talked about how to gain trust from all of the above in a previous article called Web Project Management: Honesty, Trust & Integrity and it mainly revolves around conducting yourself at all time in a manner that is clearly seen as being full of honesty and integrity no matter what temptations arise.

But, to a Web Project Manager, more valuable than any salary is having the trust of your superiors, because as we all know, when managing a web project you are the person right on the front line at all times, making critical decisions on a daily basis and are ultimately responsible for success or failure, and when this depends on more internal and external factors than you can shake a stick at, well… this is a very precarious position to be in!

I mean let’s face it, when things go well you look like a superhero, a master of your trade and an example to everyone, but, when things don’t go so well, oh my, that is when any Web Project Manager needs, and needs to see, absolute trust from their boss and for him or her not to go all Alan Sugar on them.

When your boss hears a web project is coming in over budget or late and you know for certain why, and that the reasons are mostly due to factors outside of your control, for them to listen to your reasons and say “I don’t think you did anything that wrong, web projects contain too many elements for you to be in full control of at all times.”, this, my Pedigree Chums, is music to our ears.

Web Project Manager Tip of the Day… Get your boss to read Good Project Management Doesn’t Guarantee Project Success

Of course this reaction is only possible if you have demonstrated in the past that you can effectively control web projects under the right circumstances and if it is a cast iron known fact that you always take full responsibility and admit fault if that happens to be the case, without that honesty and integrity you will never have trust from anyone.

For a Web Project Manager no amount of money in the world is a substitute for feeling trusted.

4. RELIABLE SUPPORT STAFF
As a Web Project Manager you simply do not have the time to perform every task yourself during the lifecycle of a web project, this is when support staff can seem like a gift from the Gods, but there is a massive difference between support staff and reliable support staff.

This kind of person is actually rare to find, but if you’re lucky enough to find one they can provide you with the vital breathing space you need in order to keep on top of all your web projects.

In short, a reliable web project management support member is one who you can delegate tasks too safe in the knowledge they will be completed, and to a quality level you are happy with – sounds simple, right?

Noooooo, how many times have you had to chase someone on a tasks several times, only to find that when it’s eventually finished it’s of poor quality and you mutter the immortal words under your breath “I should’ve done it my bloody self!”

An image of a lego Star Wars Stormtropper from behind who is knitting with needles and a red ball of wool“WTF, I asked you to gather content from the client an hour ago!”
DON’T JUST EXPECT SUPPORT, PROVIDE IT TOO
Of course, finding reliable web project management support is gold dust and most Web Project Managers would take this over any financial bribe, but I believe it is crucial to not only use the support you have, but to also provide reliable support too!

Offering your support to other stressed and overworked Web Project Managers (and any team members for that matter) is vitally important because it:

Encourages others to support you, and each other
Shows humility in that you don’t think you’re ‘above’ web project management support tasks
Keeps you humble by reminding you what it’s like on the other side of things
Just remember one thing… the golden rule of delegating tasks to others, is to always be on hand to support them while they’re completing them. There’s nothing worse than dumping a load of work on someone and not being around to answer questions or provide encouragement.

Always fully appreciate a person that can provide reliable web project management support, they’re often are the unsung heroes of digital agencies!

Special thank you: This is an apt point to thank my bestest pal in the world, Deb, for all the support she gives me on this blog by way of superhuman proof reading skills, thank you!!! :-)

5. UNDERSTANDING PRODUCTION TEAMS
Effectively managing digital production teams of web designers and web developers is one of the black arts of web project management. If you get a great production team on a web project it will invariably be a resounding success, but if you encounter difficult production teams, then get ready for the pain!

But before I get into the kind of digital production team a Web Project Manager wants more than money, it’s important to understand things from their perspective, and never has it been summarised better than in the quote below… a short must read for any Web Project Manager.

“Developers often treat PM as The Source of All Evil. And to some point they’re right. It’s a project manager who brings more work. It’s a project manager who bugs everyone asking when they’re going to be done.”
Pawel Brodzinski, What Can Project Manager Do For Developers?

Having worked for a few years as a front-end developer, and been ‘affectionately’ referred to as a Code Monkey I can definitely remember and understand what it’s like on the production side of a web agency.



But it’s funny how life has a way of holding a mirror up to your past behaviour as time goes by…

As people who know me will testify to, when I hear digital production teams commenting about how web projects are being run, how standards are the most important thing and that more budget is needed for proper testing, I’ll often have a little ‘old wise man giggle’ to myself and think back to the time I was saying (shouting) exactly the same things to previous bosses when on the digital production team.

But of course, once you cross over to the dark side of web project management everything changes.

WEB PROJECT MANAGEMENT, A NEW REALITY
When you transfer from the digital production side of things and become a Web Project Manager your whole world is changed forever. Even if at some stage you decide to venture back into production, you will be doing so with new commercial knowledge about the realities of running web projects and in some cases businesses themselves.

Suddenly your priority balance shifts slightly away from code standards and is weighted more towards clients, budgets and schedules. Rather than having one or two things to work on at a time for solid periods, you have a million things to deal with and numerous key decisions to make on a daily, and sometimes even hourly, basis.

As a Web Project Manager you are constantly being pulled in three directions by the client, your boss and your production team, and each of them want different things from you at all times – somehow you have to find a way to keep everyone reasonably happy at all times – this is where a Web Project Manager would sacrifice any pay rise in the world to have an understanding production team ploughing through the work!

This means that when you’re pulling a developer off the work they’re on, breaking their flow, to fix a bug raised by a client, or you ask a designer to stick to a certain level of design so you can hit budget and schedule, the dream is to have production team members who fully appreciate the pressure you’re under and happily oblige.

In most cases Web Project Managers completely understand the production team’s point of view and try to accommodate it where possible. We’ll try and organise their work into solid blocks, create task lists and test their work, but all these things have to be combined with our new pressure filled priorities, and sometimes it’s a bad mix.

An image of several lego Star Wars characters beating up a lone oneThe devs didn’t react how the Web PM had hoped to the decision
More than anything, Web Project Managers out there would just like a certain amount of understanding of this fact from production teams. For them to appreciate that as well as having pressures like cash flow, budgets, schedules and clients on their mind, they’re also are the one person who has the complete overview of the web project at all times and are making decisions based on that overview knowledge that’s ultimately best for the business and project.

Sometimes these decisions can appear stupid, rash, akin to demanding low quality work, short sighted or naive, and in some cases they are! But as I’ve learnt over time, if a Web Project Manager seems to be a reasonably intelligent person who understands what the production teams are saying, the decision they make is probably the right one for the web project or agency overall, and if the production team continues to have a job and steady flow of web projects to work on, you can be sure the decisions made weren’t too bad at all.

To all digital production teams out there, I’m pretty confident if you could spend just six months as a Web Project Manager your perspective of things would change too. You would find that when you’re pulled in lots of different directions on lots of different web projects you’re sometimes just too busy to provide the perfect brief, create all tasks as nice lists, insist on world-class quality code every time and have time to create accurate detailed functional specifications that leave not a single detail in the land of un-scoped or ambiguity…

How do I know this? Because I really was once one of you, fighting for all things good and right in the world!!

All we ask is you trust us. Our hearts are in the right place, we want the same things as you, but our priorities are weighted differently to yours. Surely there’s some happy place in the middle we can meet, and over time get to that place together by keeping our business healthy, steadily growing and profitable through a utopian mix of design masterpieces, technical wizardry and commercial realities…

THE REAL WEB PROJECT MANAGER REALITY
In the last two articles I’ve given just a few of the things Web Project Managers want more than money, but there are many more. However, the painful truth is getting all of these things is extremely unlikely and a little la la land given the real commercial world we live in.

But, by being able to identify what these things are is the first step on the path to improving how you run web projects, how to interact and conduct yourself with your team members and superiors, and if you can improve things even slightly in all those areas, you’ll be well on your way to being a happier Web Project Manager!

But enough from me… as someone managing digital accounts or projects, what things do YOU want more than money in your web project management job?

- sins

WE’VE ALL BEEN TEMPTED, WE’VE ALL BEEN THERE…
Tiresome web projects without end, endless discussions with the client, never ending resourcing problems, budget cuts, technical systems not working and changing scopes all over the place – everything turning upside down faster than you can spell change request!

No doubt about it, Web Project Management is not an easy job.

However, during my own involvement with web projects I’ve had to witness particular things which were said by team members, in front of the client, and within the team itself, and these things did nothing else but add to the confusion and difficulties that all web projects already have too much of even at the best of times, making the job of the Web Project Manager that much more challenging.

I tend to call these things the “Seven Deadly Sins of Web Project Management” and within this series of four articles I will describe and illustrate them, with examples – along with my best practice advice on how to deal with the temptations we all face.

1. VANITY – “WE KNOW BETTER THAN THE CLIENT!”
Let’s assume you work for an agency which has a certain experience in the field and has been running web projects for several years now, think how many projects have you and your team been involved in? 20? 50? Maybe even 100…

An average client has run only a few and often has only one primary goal; he or she needs to satisfy the expectations that have been set by their superiors.

While it has become commonplace in web agencies to internally share the most outrageous briefings and the insane functionality requests for a good laugh with the project team, it should always be coupled with attempting to help your client by communicating with them better.

Of course you know more about web projects and web project management – so why don’t you start educating your clients accordingly? Take the following example of client feedback we’ve all heard and laughed at:

“Thank you for the screenshot of the HTML newsletter you sent. The layout looks ok, and the copy looks good. But not a single link works in the .jpg file you’ve sent me. You are going to fix that before sending the campaign, right?”

There is a wrong and a right response to this request. If you’re pressed for time, simply reply:

“Yep, we’ll take care of everything before we send it out.”

Don’t reply with:

“This is a screen shot, you stupid butthole! Of course the links don’t work in it!”

If you’re a patient person with nerves of steel, you could say:

“Hey, thanks for your feedback. We’ll take this as approval for the newsletter layout and content, and will make sure that all the links in the final version are functional and being tracked. Our technicians cannot yet exactly predict how long it takes to complete the newsletter batch delivery for all 3428 addresses, but we have scheduled to send the first campaign blast with 500 addresses at 2am tonight.

The file you’ve reviewed represents just an image version (jpg) of the final newsletter file (HTML) and thus doesn’t include any active link functionality. This is to ensure we do not inflate the click-through numbers during testing…”

See the difference? Embedding your sharp reply inside a plethora of “this will happen next in the process” information is serving two purposes:

It gives the client more information that they can hand over to their respective superiors
It educates the client about some tiny details in web technology
A colleague of mine once labelled this approach as “killing with kindness”.

Admittedly it takes time to write such lengthy replies. But by tying your reply to the next steps in the agreed process you do yourself and your client several favours:

You’re re-assuring your own understanding of the tasks that need completing
You give them the correct language to frame the project status and next steps to their superiors
This makes it easier to deal with upcoming requests from the client’s organisation as you easily can prove how deeply intertwined the single tasks are.

Also, at all times you are depending on your client’s political position within their own organisation and are literally casting silver bullets for them that they can fire from their corporate rifle. They may use the additional and contextual information that you give them to brag, fight back unreasonable requests or to claim as their own, but in all cases you can assist in making your client appear in a brighter light by filling them with web project specific information and terminology.

Remember, as a Web Project Manager one of your many roles is to make the client look fantastic to their superiors, do this and you’ll only improve your chances of repeat business.

But wait, isn’t that the job of the Account Manager?

2. ENVY – “ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT… I COULD DO A BETTER JOB MYSELF!”
Many times I’ve witnessed Account Managers leave the office, much to the envy of the web project team and Web Project Manager as they are still clocking the hours up long into the night. As the leader of a web project team you are of course, more often than not, sharing cold pizza with your project team rather than seeing your friends and family in the evening.

But remember this distinct advantage of being a Web Project Manager over an Account Manager… by definition – A web project is a temporary endeavour with a fixed start and end date and so sooner or later it will be over – Account Management is never over.

Nothing prevents any client from calling up your fellow Account Manager at 10pm to discuss an article about how the latest web trends in viral marketing will influence the company’s performance on social media perception within the next twelve months from now on.

What looks so easy during daytime often proves to require an “always on” mentality for Account Managers, and trust me, wining and dining with clients is not as much fun as it sounds (although the food and drinks are on the house, mostly).

The only currency that an Account Manager has is trust. However, gaining, and keeping, the client’s trust is essential for both Web Project Managers and Account Managers.

But while Web Project Managers have very clear boundaries – delivering web projects – Account Manager’s success criteria are a little more blurry. While Web Project Managers may get adulation and praise for their constant supportive role (aka pulling rabbits out of hats – aka saving the client’s butt), Account Managers often find it more difficult to get famous for their deeds.

Maybe that is the reason why Account Managers are so often interfering and messing around with web projects, and the people involved in them, when it is not necessary – because it seems so much easier and more instantly rewarding when compared with what they normally do.

It occasionally seems to me that it’s the Account Manager’s secret job to promise what others have to deliver with no real clear idea if it is even possible, but the reality is a usually more brittle than that – thus putting the Account Manager in a difficult position.

While Web Project Managers have to deliver within a defined scope, Account Managers have to account for future scopes. At any time, a current client can approach a direct competitor of yours to begin talks about receiving the same service with improved quality and lower costs.

The Account Manager’s job is precisely this – to decrease the likelihood of this happening.

Operational, tactical and strategic are the names of the fictional stages of the continuum that both types of Web Managers have to tackle on a daily basis. While the operational side deals more with things that have already been agreed (projects and deliverables), the strategic level deals more with the ‘yet unknown things to come’, involving, for example, planned co-operations with institutions nobody has yet heard of and the instant need for ramping up your agency’s workforce by 385% within the next eight months.

The really tricky thing is that the Account Manager is held responsible for is the substantial monetary growth of the account through targets based on many unknowns.

So as a Web Project Manager, while continuing to attempt to keep the Account Manager away from the day to day running of your project, understand why Account Managers may insist on doing this before berating them.

In Part 2 Michael discusses his next two Deadly Sins of Web Project Management. How to keep web projects on budget without having to ask the client for an additional 2 million, and how the Web Project Manager should be willing to serve the project first and themselves second – Gluttony and Lust.

3. GLUTTONY – “WE NEED TO INCREASE THE PROJECT BUDGET BY 2 MILLION”
Gone are the days when clients seemed to have endless budgets allocated to an emerging digital medium and where they hoped to mark their claims on the Western frontier.

Today, more and more payments are tied to specific milestones, preliminary approvals by the steering group and successfully conducted functionality tests that are based on the use case descriptions, which may postpone a web project phase’s payment for six weeks.

It all depends on what kind of organisation you are working in and whether you’re paid by the efforts your team has put in, for meeting certain functionality criteria or for something else judged by some obscure stakeholders somewhere else in the world – big money spends on web projects have become scarce over the last few years, and you had better be fully aware that there is no more budget for your project – even if the customer has changed the scope countless times at will.

Either way, in these difficult times for the digital industry a Web Project Manager needs to find ways to keep delivering with reduced budgets and less margin for error that ultimately hit your already financially fragile web agency.

Here are two ways to deal with the constant problem of web project budget overrun:

Overspending
Shadow budgeting
OVERSPENDING
This is always a calculated bet on the future. It is the technique whereby a Web Project Manager or Account Manager justifies web project overspend by assuming that future projects for the same client will allow them to claw back the project overspend for the current one.

SHADOW BUDGETING
Shadow budgeting is the art of working to lower budgets than you actually have in order to cater for the inevitable overrun – best case is you deliver under budget and achieve some internal process or skills development while being paid, worst case is you deliver on budget – not a bad worst case scenario, I think you’ll agree.

You start by taking the budget which you have for a given project phase or deliverable and you simply reduce this budget by 20% and consider the remaining 80 per cent from now on your available budget for this phase or deliverable.

Your team may mourn, but here’s how you can explain it so that they are more likely to follow your approach…

Most project deliverables follow Pareto’s 80/20 rule – 80% of the outcome of a project deliverable is realised with only 20% of the effort put in. It usually swallows all remaining budget to complete a deliverable – particularly due to long review cycles and more iterations than planned.

Plus, your client may indeed be happy with a preliminary 20% deliverable to collect instant feedback from within their own organisation even before your agency has put in all the efforts in to complete the whole stage.

In the end the client’s organisation may scrap it all anyway because your deliverable may not meet their high expectations – so why not give them sneak previews instead?

My best advice is to involve your team in this from the start! Let your team decide how to share the most laborious tasks. As a Web Project Manager, get your hands dirty in the practical preparations. Touch code, review copy texts, cut images – simply suck in as many practical issues as you can and familiarise yourself with the strains of fatigue and boring repetitive tasks.

Encourage your team to divide labour, to share what they learn and discover along the way, to focus on tasks which require a lot of concentration only for an hour at a time and to review and question each other’s work.

Allocate half of the shadowed budget for this stage (10%) to scrutinise and streamline the team efforts for getting the original deliverable out with more nifty tools, better material preparation, machine-based data enhancements and a smarter repository structure.

Make it a team effort to elaborate on solutions for the never ending need for further streamlining! Equip every piece of material with hooks and handles so that you can re-process and re-use it along the way.

As plenty of the original budget for phase conclusion is usually spent on implementing what was originally agreed in the first place, you need to free the team from the inability to revoke their original ideas, and because some of these efforts are spent on repetitive tasks, you may be lucky enough to pocket the famous learning curve effect which usually come along with repetitive tasks and may account for as much as 30% of the original 80% phase budget.

Any Euro, Pound, Dollar or Zloty spent on thinking about how to solve a problem can lead to totally new, and unpredicted, ways to get things done, and with considerably less effort and thus more cost effectively for future projects – think long-term.

With the other 10% of your shadowed budget – spend it on thinking through the consequences of the chosen setup. You may find that with only a relatively small additional effort, you can put time into those mythical documentation and show cases!

4. LUST – “NON SERVIAM!”
I can’t help but notice the occasional unwillingness among Web Project Managers to serve.

By this, I don’t mean the feeling that one would have to stoop when the customer lets the proverbial soap slip – I mean the ability to let your own Web Project Manager personality evaporate into the background in favour of something else more honourable and geared towards getting things done together for the team.

It is a platitude that any kind of management only has two ways to get anything done – action and communication.

Communication without action is simply pretending, and action without communication will never lead anywhere. Big gestures, speeches, or any other kind of ‘pep talk’ are not really well suited for motivating people’s participation without follow through.

The inability or unwillingness to serve can be easily attributed to what psychologists call: narcism. However, it may lead further to take another angle and approach this topic through the back door.

We have, thanks to the genius of the sociologist Max Weber, a term for coining what might make the essential difference here – it’s called work ethics. At its core it can be surmised as “working hard will please…later”.

The distinction between hard work in the present and a gratification in the future is the core personality attribute that distinguishes an average Web Project Manager from an excellent Web Project Manager.

Contrasting this approach with the mentioned distinction between “action” (from Latin “agere” – to do) and “communication” (from Latin “communicare” – to share, to make common) indicates the direction of the reference inherent in both terms – towards oneself vs. towards something beyond oneself.

I believe the trouble with the stated “unwillingness to serve” is the coherence between one’s actual deeds and the expected or well deserved gratification structure behind the deeds. Or from the opposite perspective, it is the inability to classify one’s own deeds into coherence beyond the benefit for oneself.

If a Web Project Manager is primarily concerned about their own reputation (their lust for praise from others), status or comfort, it will undoubtedly have a negative effect on the team’s motivation to walk the extra mile with them.

Who has ever met a Web Project Manager that leaves the office during a laborious end phase of a website production on the evening before go-live with the reasoning “I have to attend my dance class”? If you have you have every right to scorn at their own perceived right to call themselves a Manger of any description.

To manage means to lead, and leading is located in the action domain, not in the communication domain.

In Part 3 of the series, Michael discusses how to resist getting angry with clients when the temptation is overwhelming, and how to control the scope of web projects by defining clear specifications and project scope from the outset – Anger and Covetousness

5. ANGER – “DEAR CLIENT, AS YOU FAILED TO RESPOND TO MY EARLIER EMAILS…”
I come across many Web Project Managers who seem to personally suffer from the client’s inability to give feedback in good time. Though this is an annoying fact, in some situations it has to be attributed to a Web Project Manager’s inability to cater for this situation – beforehand, or as it emerges.

Trust me, even if you happen to inherit a web project where you are dealing with non-responsive client, not all is lost, yet. Countless intelligent people have devised Web Project Management documentation frameworks which would anticipate this situation, and prevent the worst case from happening.

However, I haven’t seen many web projects where all of this ideal world project documentation was in a grade A condition from the start (not even the ones I have started from scratch!), but then again, I’ve never worked with clients who wouldn’t have accepted a mode shift along the way, either.

But, if you have ever been forced to wait for client approval beyond the launch deadline you surely were caught between a rock and a hard place. As soon as this happens once, you are fully entitled to ask for a change in the mode of operation. In my experience, web projects tend to suffer from bottlenecks which are related to the allocation of time within the client’s organisation rather than your own.

BENEFITS OF PROJECT COMMUNICATION LOGGING
I had a client once who was managing a time-critical launch bound to an event where he had to participate in person and where he couldn’t be reached by email or phone for the whole afternoon while material was missing from God-knows-where.

We decided to go live with non-approved interim content. The client cried “Betrayal!” and refused to pay the bill.

I said “OK!” and stated I would simply send the project log (where all web project communication was recorded) via my boss to his boss to document the issue on behalf of our project team.

“You’re keeping a project log?” he said, with an amount of fear.

I replied, “Listen – do you really think that we, as a web project delivery organisation, wouldn’t organise and document our own web project delivery process? This is what we do for a living!”

Whether this project log exists or not is up for debate, but my advice is only ever be bitchy if you have evidence!

However, it is somewhat ironic how rarely the principles of Web Project Management are applied to the Web Project Management process itself. Managing the Web Project Management process is one of the most worthwhile tasks – and one of the most essential for complete confidence and stability on-going.

WEB PROJECT DELIVERY DEFINITION
In order to minimise situations like the above from ever happening, what I try to do from the start with any web project I am involved in, and if I fail, do as soon as I find the time or as the need emerges is:

I re-negotiate the prerequisites of delivery. Any web project which I have ever seen is based on assumptions e.g. “if we use framework XYZ, we’ll be fine” and “we’ll get all the materials in time”, and not forgetting the assumptions formulated out of pure madness like “we can do last changes on the materials in the two hours before we go live with it”
Whenever I read a web project briefing, or an RFP, I take a piece of paper and note down under which circumstances the stuff I read makes a reasonable request. And particularly, what are the likely points of failure?
As a result, my latest web projects had quite impressive sections in the Management Summary part of the web project agreement document.

One is labelled Assumptions and the other is labelled Prerequisites and they match the headlines on my auxiliary notes. One listing general delivery-related things and the other is listing items with regard to the project delivery schedule.

The first section states “Tool access is granted by the client” and the second states the deadline associated with it “Tool access is granted until 16.09.” which is exactly the start date for a project phase relying on the availability of certain things.

You’ll get the point here, I’m sure.

Needless to say that I, in some cases, failed to hand in the web project agreement document on time due to the extensive additions to the project agreement which was originally drafted. For times such as these it always becomes handy to formulate the essential “Three sentences why this document is late” for yourself, and for your Account Manager who will no doubt steal the formulated and re-usable excuse.

In one case the client went as far as to verbally convey their suspicion that I might be “not quite up to the task, maybe ‘incompetent’, or just a little inexperienced?” Thanks to the preparation, my Account Manager was prepared to extinguish this fire with a smile despite the fact they had asked for a simple task equivalent to order the following from your favourite bartender:

“One beer, but the foam on the bottom of the glass please!” – They got it and we got paid for it.

6. COVETOUSNESS – “SURE. THIS FEATURE WILL COST YOU €10K”
As you may have guessed from what you’ve read before in this series or from experience, an unreasonable demand doesn’t get any better, regardless of how often you repeat it.

The key to make people pay for the things they are desperately asking for, which is beyond the agreed scope, is to comprehensively document the interdependencies between the parts of the puzzle for all to see from day one.

Working with a detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) document makes this a much easier task. Everyone will have their own take on creating a WBS, but this is mine step-by-step:

Download WBS Template »

Transfer the different high-level stages of the project to pieces of paper – one phase goes on one piece of paper – or put it in an Excel file, if you want
Think about the competency contributions you will need for each of the phases and how they relate e.g. What do you need to get done by Web Designers in each phase? Is there anything that Software Architects or Web Developers can contribute, prepare, or review in a particular early phase of the project?
Add according lines to your paper, or add empty lines to your Excel. If the phases are in column A, put the tasks to be performed by particular competencies to column B. In both cases add marks to who is contributing in a separate column
Put all deliverables that you need as input for any of the phases in the upper left corner of every sheet. Making sure to note down which competency is contributing to which item in a separate column in the same place
Finally, try to envisage how the different contributions fall together into separate tasks. A Web Designer surely has to:
Select the images for the web site
Manipulate the images
Finish them for web usage with sharpening, compression and naming them according to the defined naming conventions
Think about who uploads these images to the web site repository: the Web Developer? A Content Editor? The Project Manager? The Holy Ghost?
You will find both new tasks which are not covered in the basic project agreement new assignments which haven’t been thought of yet
What you will end up with, is complete knowledge you can present to your team, superiors and client on what action sequences need to happen in order to deliver e.g. There no point in uploading images which haven’t been selected and/or made ready for web usage, right? The dependency is created.

In the end, add the outcome of this examination to your sheets (preferably with a different colour).

Deliverables are marked with a right arrow (deliverable_X -> phase_Y), inputs to further phases are marked with a similar arrow on their left (phase_Y->input_X). Make sure every deliverable of one phase matches an input to another phase. Assign numbers with high-level phases get a single digit number “1”, subsequent packages get “1.1”; particular competence contributions get “1.1.1” and so on…

And there you have it, a WBS document, matching both the output dimension of phase X and the input dimension for phase Y. Split by competencies, bound to web project phases and reflecting the actual deeds and work packages for everyone to see and track throughout the project’s lifecycle. Splendid!

In the final part of this brilliant series, Part 4, Michael talks about Sloth, the last of the Web Project Management deadly sins. It deals specifically with the constant struggle Web Project Managers have when trying to allocate resource to their projects only to discover there is none available.

7. SLOTH – “WE DON’T HAVE MORE RESOURCES!”
As Sam Barnes comprehensively covered in his recent article “Web Projects: How to keep the peace when making decisions”, one of the saddest facts in a Web Project Manager’s life is indeed the multitude of expectations they to deal with, for example:

The client expects your organisation to be flexible enough to catch up with a five day delays in material preparation without any effect on the deadline
Your Accounting department expects that they can issue this phase’s invoice as planned before to ensure the cash flow
Your HR people are expecting you to make precise resource allocations for projects with an unknown scope, with a slipping deadline, and with a shrinking budget
But no matter what pressure you are under, please don’t ever give this article’s headline quote of “We don’t have the resources!” out to any of your clients! If you do, you will literally destroy the agency’s reputation that your Account Manager has built up over the years with his bare hands.

Here are two reasons why you should refrain from saying it:

You will ruin your reputation as you’re probably lying without even realising it!
One of your most important tasks is to keep your business away from the client
Of course your company has more resources! It will almost certainly be just a fraction of your agency’s workforce that you have allocated for your web project so far. As soon as more than one web project is handled at your company at one time there are more resources. The sad and brutal truth is that you probably do have the resource in-house, but just can’t access them or allocate them to your tasks – your organisation simply wouldn’t allow that to happen! So, admitting that you can’t get any more resources other than the ones you have assembled as workforce on their project is a bad thing to do. Just ask yourself the following question:

As for keeping your business away from the client, consider this example.

If you bring your car to a car repair shop – you don’t really expect the clerk to tell you intimate details about the workload of his staff, right? All you want to get is your car repaired. And thus you may accept the clerk saying: “Sorry. For this week we are already full. But you could bring in your car next Tuesday at 8 in the morning!” You really don’t expect any more information on the matter why you can’t get you car fixed before that.

The struggle for resources is one of the biggest challenges a Web Project Manager will face. It is however not the client’s concern how your web project staffing is addressed.

DEALING WITH RESOURCING ISSUES
There are however a couple of techniques and replies which you can apply to situations where you are asked to stretch your project organisation beyond capability. They all boil down to the fact that it is essential for you to buy time, and to sequence the requests in a reasonable manner by constantly re-applying the distinction between urgent and important throughout a project.

If you have followed the advice assembled in this article so far you already have some good replies at hand to answer client requests about additional deliverables.

Several more re-usable Web Project Management snippets you may want to consider for any future resourcing situation include:

“I would need to look into the implications on schedule and budget before I can give you confirmation on this matter.”
Remember, all the tasks and phases are deeply intertwined!
“Upon initial thought it seems as if this request is enhancing the agreed functionality requirements. I’ll have this analysed by our technical experts first and get back to you.”
Remember, a significant scope enhancement will ruin one or more of the Assumptions and/or Prerequisites under which the Web Project Agreement has been issued originally and may result in filing a Change Request. Once clients see the price tag implied by their request, they may consider it “not that urgent / important”
“I can only think of two people in my organisation that would have an instant answer to whether this is possible with the given system. Let me quickly see if I can contact any of them.”
Grab your phone while saying that. Remember, you are representing a team of experts, giving everything to satisfy client’s needs as they emerge!
“The team for this week is completely allocated with coping for the unpredicted delay in the provision of material. We can have a look at this request next Tuesday at 8 in the morning!”
Remember to know where you and your team are with the tasks agreed and what is the most urgent thing, as opposed to important, to take care of is essential
For every additional task that ends up on your project team’s plate you have to consider one or two possible ways to deal with it. It depends a lot on the project team and the organisation you are working for and it also depends on how your organisation rates the importance of the project or client in question, but below is some general advice on how to try and squeeze in unexpected work into an already packed schedule if need be.

First, you could squeeze the task into the existing schedules, ordering your team to work overtime. You can promise compensation or certain gratifications for those who are volunteering for the extra work. Or simply assign the task to someone whom you consider fit for the job. This principle can be referred to as heroic management e.g. “It’s a shitty job – but somebody has to do it!”

Secondly, you could count on the advice and ingenuity of your project team. Make the task description as clear as you can and involve your project team in solving the matter. Discuss openly what other tasks can be shuffled around, postponed or distributed to more shoulders?

Is the new task truly a specialist’s task – or could anybody work on it? How would the team rate the chances to get the additional work equally distributed with only a couple of additional hours for everybody? This principle can be referred to as post-heroic management e.g. “It’s an inconvenience which forces us to re-shuffle already allocated tasks in a smart way!”

Last but not least, it largely depends on what kind of personality you are. If you are not able to contribute hands-on to the project (as you may not know how to operate a text editor, Adobe Photoshop, or a Content Management System) – you can always try to learn these things from your project team members and do the job yourself.

If you are not willing to contribute hands-on to the project because you do not consider this being a part of your responsibility – you can always try to get another job. The choice is yours.

IN SUMMARY
Web Project Management, for which I sketched its shortcomings in the previous articles, will undoubtedly flop if it is carried out with the wrong focus and if it is aiming at the wrong goals.

The postulated deadly sins can, and shall be of course, all interpreted as examples of individual failure. In Web Projects, I have seen otherwise reasonable Web Project Managers being caught in selfish traps because they pig-headedly insisted on having the exclusively correct situation assessment and response for a particular question, issue, or project stage.

In the current economic climate it can prove deadly for a whole web agency if the management doesn’t see the wood for the trees – and each of the postulated deadly sins can easily obstruct the view on more important issues.

Web Project Management is far more a continuous business re-engineering strategy than simply the completion of pre-defined and well formulated task lists with known time, money, and competence allocations.

It requires, following one thought from the German sociologist Dirk Baecker, a type of management which sees its heroism no longer at the disposal of resources and the willingness to fight offending or unreasonable customer demands, but which requires serendipity for the factual and social dimensions of the organisation of work and the distribution of shared responsibility which comes along with that.

We are heading towards an age of post heroic management, for which two aspects seem essential to me:

The Web project Manager’s ability to let his personal motivations, goals and rewards fade into the background, and…
Each team member’s ability to re-think their own contribution beyond a structure of assessment, delivery and hierarchy
This concludes the Web Project Management: Seven Deadly Sins series. A big thank you to Michael for writing this incredibly extensive and enlightening article which has certainly taught me a thing a thing or two and I hope you feel the same too.


## Facilitating Others

My role as Web Project Manager is to make everyone’s job as productive and stress free as possible.

With focus on web designers and developers, but true for the whole project team, let me explain…

WEB TEAM EXPERTISE FOCUS
Over the years I’ve seen digital agencies making big mistakes when it comes to effective web project management. One of the most common mistakes was having production team members e.g. web designers and developers performing web project management tasks rather than keeping them focussed on what they do best, designing and developing.



Web designers and web developers are highly skilled people and nothing will destroy their passion, productivity and morale quicker than having them involved in areas of a web project that stop them from doing what they love and do best, designing and developing.

The range of tasks that can stop these experts from doing what they’re hired to do are endless, but what is finite is that when it comes to web project team management, one primary goal of a Web Project Manager is to do everything within their power to ensure these guys and gals don’t get sidetracked or bogged down in things that will reduce the quality of their work.

The minute this happens the effectiveness of the team is diluted, momentum is reduced and Web Project Managers need to understand this.

Whether you used to be a web designer or developer or not, you have to appreciate that when these guys are in the zone and working hard to meet deadlines you probably set out for them, stopping to answer the phone, an e-mail or an ad hoc question can seriously break their flow and it takes time to get back into it.

WEB PROJECT MANAGERS ARE STRESS SPONGES
Another key aspect to being a good Web Project Manager is keep the production teams as stress free as possible by absorbing as much stress for them as you can.

A picture of a funny sign on a door that has a circle with the instructions Bang Head HereThis should be included in Web Project Manager induction packs
Although never on any Web Project Manager Job description, it should be assumed that part of the role is to basically take crap on behalf of your team in such a way that they don’t even get a whiff of it, even if they’re the cause of it.

During a web project there are a zillion things that will happen that will cause stress, but a test of your team management leadership skills is to see how much of this stress you can personally absorb in such a way that your production team don’t feel the heat, why?

Simply because a stressed web designer or developer will not work as well as a happy one.

WHY SHOULD I TAKE ALL THE CRAP!?
Many Web Project Managers out there have asked this question and it’s a valid one, but the answer is because it’s your job.

Think about it, your boss right now, do you think he or she is completely open with all members of their company about all the issues that exist right now? Of course not. While they may be transparent with many about certain workflow or revenue concerns they don’t bother the design or development teams with tax or buildings insurance issues.

A photograph of a large ginger cat standing inside a glass jar with the caption I has a Force FieldWeb Project Managers must shield their teams
There is a reason for this, it’s because it would serve no purpose other than to make everyone worry, and what happens when people are worried? They start to feel negative and this will only result in negative impact across the entire company.

Although a rather elaborate example, the theory is the same as to why you as a Web Project Manager should take all the crap you can and shield your web project team from it – because your job is to keep your team positive, motivated and focussed on their job – and if this means taking some crap you know you don’t deserve then so be it.

If you don’t like the sound of this then you have no business being a Web Project Manager, or a manager of any kind for that matter.

WEB PROJECT MANAGERS PLAY RHYTHM GUITAR
If you want to be a good Web Project Manager you should try to aim to be a rhythm guitarist rather than play lead guitar or sing lead vocals.

By this I mean you should understand that your job is to sit behind the boys and girls that get all the attention for finished products and make sure everything runs smoothly without expecting any glory – for example, in the video below I’m not the pretty boy on lead, but his much wiser looking band mate on the left… cool eh!



Or as my Dad once told me, a good rhythm guitarist keeps the song going in such a way that when they’re playing you tend not to notice, but if they were taken away you immediately notice and the song falls flat on its face.

I’ve worked on many web projects in the past where the final website or application was delivered and all the praise was focussed around how beautiful the end product looked or how amazing this or that piece of functionality was – and the point here is that despite no one saying how great the web project management was, I didn’t mind one bit – I took an enormous amount of silent pleasure at the smiles on the faces of the designers and developers as they were patted on the back.

In many cases only I knew what stresses there was along the way and how much crap I’d taken on behalf of the team, and on occasion how I’d opted to make myself look at fault rather than make sure blame was assigned to who it should’ve been, but I kept it quiet and sat there smiling to myself because I had done my job.

And while this may all sound like some kind of self-proclaimed nobility and humility, it really isn’t. I just adamantly believe that a Web Project Manager’s greatest success should come in the form of being able to sit back and watch others be praised knowing that behind it all was you – I get more pleasure and satisfaction from that then receiving praise myself and have noticed this is a common trait among Web Project Managers the more I meet.

But I deserve some credit surely!?

PEOPLE AREN’T STUPID, RESPECT WILL COME
Of course Web Project Managers deserve credit for successful web projects, but I personally find that this comes over time, but if you’re like me it’s not so much credit that you want, it’s respect, and respect from not only management by the production team too.

A photo of a young boy dressed up as a little gangster rap artistRespect lil man!
In the heat of the moment when you’re taking the crap from someone or for someone it can often make you question why you’re bothering, after all Web Project Managers are just human too. Every part of you wants to shout out that actually it’s not your fault and it’s his or hers, and why should you be suffering all the stress when you’re not at fault.

But if you continually stay strong and show strength of character your manager and production teams will start to notice just what part you play in the success and appreciate it.

This not only means you can look yourself in the mirror at night knowing you’ve retained your dignity when others would’ve play the blame game, but you also gain an awful lot of respect that in the long term will actually reduce your own stress levels as people want to work for you more and more.

It’s kind of a strange philosophy but it seems to work – make your mission to make everyone else look good without ever expecting reward or credit, and somehow you end up looking good and receiving reward and credit.

Anyone who sets out on a mission to make themselves look good and receive reward or credit above their team – always seem to end up looking like dickheads.

So what can you do to minimise getting a ‘dickhead’ label?

WEB PROJECT MANAGER ANTI-DICKHEAD TIPS
Below are my top ten tips of how to make web designer’s and developer’s jobs as easy and stress free as possible by keeping them focussed on what they do best, which of course makes your web projects run smoother – if you get some respect along the way then consider it a bonus, not a birth right.

Try to pick the right moments to disturb them with questions e.g. be observant enough to realise when they’re in ‘the zone’
Don’t just forward website or application issues to them, try to identify the problem yourself so they can easily replicate the issue and get to work on the solution rather than investigation
Don’t drag them into meetings they don’t need to be in. If questions come up that they’re best to answer, take a note and get back to whoever once you have the answer
Be willing to push back clients or other teams if they need more time
Never say something is urgent when the truth is it’s easier for you to pressure them than to have an awkward conversation with someone else
Don’t let them work too much overtime to hit a target, if burn out is looking possible, send them home and take crap from the boss yourself
Have the balls to defend your team to management when it would be easier to blame them
Don’t gossip with them about web project politics, keep that to yourself
Put yourself in their shoes and make sure they get the files and documents they need in an organised manner
Never ever see yourself as above them

## Success Criteria

- project performance budget
- project goals
- timelines
- bugs
- team happiness

‘m writing this article in response to a common question I get asked… what exactly does make a great Web Project Manager?

I believe the reasons I get asked this so often is because the existing articles out there that define what makes a great project manager don’t include the “web” part and either focus on I.T. project management or just project management in general.

A yellow with age photograph of a young man in a suit at his office desk in the 1950sCorporate project management has a sexy reputation
However it should be noted that many of the points made in these articles are very relevant to web project management, for example, The 12 Attributes of an Effective Project Manager.

For those who are just too damn busy (lazy) to click the link and read, it lists a few attributes that a good project manager should ideally have, e.g.:

Skill in negotiating win-win solutions between stakeholders and the project team
Staying calm particularly during turbulent times
Desire to hold the team accountable for deliverables
Ability to earn the respect of the team regardless of reporting relationships
It should go without saying that these attributes are as applicable to someone managing the construction of a carbon freezing unit as a web project, or put another way, GreatWebProjectManager extends GreatProjectManager.

Here are a few more similar articles that are worth a read:

Characteristics of Great Project Managers
How to Be a Good Project Manager
The Best Project Manager in the World
But here lies the problem; we are awash with articles explaining what makes a great project manager, but what makes a great WEB Project Manager?

Is it the unique ability to be able to annoy clients, their Managing Directors, design and development teams in one day? Hadouken!!!! K.O.

A group of nerdy looking kids dressed up in Street Fighter costumesI definitely wouldn’t mess with any of these killers
Or perhaps it’s their powerful skills in having chronic OCD but somehow avoiding medical diagnosis for their entire life?

Ok ok, while these are things all Web Project Managers are proud of; be it secretly or openly, let’s get serious on what really makes a great Web Project Manager…

WEB PROJECT MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE
Of course “experience” is something, that if you have it, makes you a more wise and skilled person in anything and web project management is no different. But the key distinction here is between web project management experience and experience working on web projects.

Often you’ll find all sorts of different people from different backgrounds running web projects, from designers and developers to digital account managers and I.T. managers, but while all of these people will no doubt manage to deliver the website or web application, more often than not, there are noticeable lapses in certain areas that cause web project difficulties and these lapses are where an experienced web project manager really shows their value.

Often the lapses will be in the areas that are the weaker area of the person managing, for example, often a digital account manager will be great at building a rapport with the client, but will commit to unrealistic deadlines or miss functionality out of the scoping stage.

A designer will often ensure the design looks world class but fail to realise that by delivering a world class design with a zillion overlays and cool UI features, the entire project budget will be blown on front-end development.

An experienced Web Project Manager will be aware of these common “gotchas” and direct the project accordingly, making sure all aspects of the project have balanced attention and are aligned with the scope, budget and timelines while maintaining a level of quality both agency and client are happy with.

HANDS-ON DIGITAL EXPERIENCE
As with most project management positions, although definitely not always the case, it’s often a huge advantage if you have hands-on experience of the disciplines involved in the project – the same is true for web projects.

I’m always in awe of web project managers who deliver great solutions having never used paths to cut something out in Photoshop, turned a PSD into a HTML template or created a Hello World script in a server side language.

The fact of the matter is these Web Project Managers are out there and doing a fine job but I genuinely believe a Web Project Manager with hands-on practical experience in the disciplines required in web projects is a valuable aid for the reasons Luc Richard gives:

To be an effective project manager, you must be capable of designing and developing the solution yourself. Otherwise, you have two options. You can either (a) ask others to make decisions for you, or (b) simply pretend you know what you’re talking about. In the first case, you’re a project co-ordinator. In the second case, you’re a project mangler.
Must Project Managers Be Technically Savvy?

However while I don’t agree that to be a great Web Project Manager you need to be capable of delivering the solution alone, I do agree that without a good grounding in all the web project’s disciplines you really are at the mercy of your team when it comes to estimating effort, scheduling tasks, assessing risks and generally making sure everything goes smoothly by being able to anticipate and avoid problems.

Plus, the harsh truth is, having hands-on experience allows you to spot when any of the production team are just flat out slacking or spinning a yarn about why problems are occurring…

Come on, I dare any Web Project Manager out there to deny that they get a sense of smug joy when they teach someone on the production team something about Photoshop or code, or laugh at the ridiculously long estimate you’re given to change a banner – oh their little faces, they look like startled little Ewoks :-)

A photograph of three toy Ewoks lined up saying they're amazed a project manager just explained how to fix a CSS bugProduction teams are so cute n fuzzy awww
But, in the defence of all production teams out there, they do a really hard job and having to design or code under pressure really is a tough thing. This is another reason why a great Web Project Manager will have spent their time on the production side of things and really be understanding and empathetic with their team in times of stress and woe, and in some cases even fight the corner of the production team to management and clients when unrealistic schedules are being proposed.

But it should be said, if you’ve found yourself running web projects having come from a position of little hands-on experience, such as account management, don’t remain ignorant to what these guys do, I believe it’s your duty to open up Photoshop, HTML editor and get Apache, MySQL and PHP running and just start learning the absolute basics.

I’m not talking about designing a website or developing the operating system for the Death Star (I can here the Apple and Linux groupies shouting it would be a Windows-based system of course, tut), but just learn enough so that you can talk to your team on their level and also explain to clients how things work, trust me, it will benefit you massively in the long run and it honestly isn’t that hard, you just need the drive and motivation to want to better yourself.

ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH EVERYONE
With any project management role, a key skill is the ability to be able to effectively communicate with everyone involved in the web project knowledgably and on their level.

While hands-on experience will arm you with the knowledge to talk to designers and developers with confidence, communicating with suppliers, your superiors and clients is a whole different ball game – a great Web Project Manager has to be a chameleon!

A photo of a toy chameleon perched on top of a computer monitor in an officeI’m literally not moving until you finish that login form
As most seasoned Web Project Managers out there know, when talking to designers or developers you often have to adapt your tone in order to communicate effectively.

Warning! Obscene stereotyping commencing
Please recall all the comments you’ve made about PMs in general and then continue reading, humbled and ashamed
For example, when talking to designers you have to appreciate that most are extremely territorial about their work and so you have to respect that and frame your questions and feedback accordingly, because the last thing you want on your web project team is a designer who doesn’t feel trusted by you and has been reduced to a pixel pusher.

With developers it’s slightly different; these guys tend to want things explained in logical straightforward steps. If you start to try and tell them how to code or insist they “code something quick and dirty” they will immediately hate you and fantasise about watching you in a fight to the death with the Rancor monster (probably while a naked Princess Lea sits by their side)

However, these personality traits are not negatives, everyone is different and these traits are actually part of the magical formula that makes a great designer or developer. Part of working a team is learning how to work with other people that are very different to you.

But while speaking to designers and developers you can have little geeky laughs about Comic Sans and drop shadows, or how bad that code is due to all its embedded CSS and JavaScript, but when you hit the meeting room with your bosses or clients a Web Project Manager has to change their skin again.

Your boss generally just wants to hear how things are going and if there are any barriers they can help remove for you. Although they have a genuine interest in the quality of design or code being produced, they are busy people and tend to want to be told about results and the impact on the business.

Likewise with clients you have to shift again and focus on what the project, and each decision made during its lifecycle, brings to the table in terms of achieving the business aims and ROI rather than hearing how the CSS3 you’ve used is ground breaking stuff.

An office worker asleep while on the phoneUh huh, CSS3… uh huh HTML5 uh huh… zzzz
Being able to adapt to, and blend into, each very different environment at the flick of a switch is something a great Web Project Manager can do and often where average ones tend to fall a little short.

IN SUMMARY
I believe what separates a great Web Project Manager from an average one is the ability to look at a web project and be able to envisage the whole solution in its entirety from an early stage and with few gaps, thus being able to manage the project’s risks and maintain momentum.

They’ll be able to understand the creative requirements almost as well as a designer, the technical requirements almost as well as a developer and communicate both in a way that results in clear tasks that need to be completed and the perfect solution being delivered, all while not being sniggered at for pretending to play at being knowledgeable in these areas but instead gaining respect.

Perhaps some of the technology requirements are out of the Web Project Manager’s comfort zone; well the great ones will go home, dig in and do a bit of research until they feel comfortable they have grasped the basics.

A great Web Project Manager should be able to produce good project plans, schedules, sitemaps, wireframes and functional specifications that production teams can work from with ease, rather than loose, fuzzy, vague and ambiguous documents that are recipes for disaster and all too commonly produced by people just wanting to pass the work onto someone else.

They’ll also be able to keep production teams motivated and focussed on producing quality work while taking all of the crap and stress from all directions in an attempt to shield them and let them work their magic unimpeded by project politics.

And finally a great Web Project Manager will be able to talk to everyone involved on their level and in their language which leaves everyone in no doubt of the expectations and objectives of the project.

Am I a great Web Project Manager? No, but I strive to be and so should you. Is the above a complete list of everything that separates great Web Project Managers from the not so great? No, but it’s a bloody good start.

What do you think separates a great Web Project Manager from an average one?

WHAT ON EARTH IS A KPI?
A KPI, or Key Performance Indicator, is simply a measurable metric by which a project can be judged as a success or not in accordance with the client’s primary aims for the project. For each KPI a pre-launch metric is recorded and post-launch the same metric is recorded, thus providing the data for an objective comparison.

KPIs can be defined as financial or non-financial targets, examples of typical KPIs for web projects are as follows:

Increase the amount of leads via the website by 10%
Increase online conversions by 5%
Reduce the time Customer Services team spend dealing with telephone queries
Increase newsletter subscriptions
Generate 10% more traffic
Get higher competitive key phrase search engine rankings
Often KPIs that are more difficult to measure will often be put forward by a client, such as:

Increase brand awareness
Improve usability
Increase time spent on the website
Although more difficult to measure, it is possible to use some KPIs like those above as long as the necessary metrics can be collected but the time required to do so should be made clear to the client upfront. For example, usability could be measured on the current site, and then measured again on the new site, but it would require the same controlled conditions and user groups for both – possible, but possibly time consuming and difficult to replicate.

The key ingredients to a KPI are the ‘before and after’ metrics that allow for an equal comparison of numbers to determine success levels.

But wait, so if I define some KPIs with the client it means at the end it could be proven the project wasn’t a fantastic success? Correct, but KPIs are good for both client and web agency.

WHY KPIS ARE GOOD FOR WEB AGENCIES
Aside from the obvious client benefits of being able to set, and hopefully achieve, their desired business aims with the web project, KPIs also keep web agencies focussed on what they’re really being hired to do – add value to the client’s business. After all, if a web agency delivers a website or web application that looks beautiful, is coded beautifully and accessible to all but fails to satisfy the aims of the client’s business and facilitate growth, quite simply, the web agency has not done their job.

Not only will the web agency have not done their job, but the client will inevitably be unhappy with the results and this damages the chance of possible repeat business, testimonials, case studies and referrals, and as a web agency, sales as a result of these are the true keys to stability and expansion.

But sales aside, KPIs are good for web agencies because they ensure all teams remain focussed on the business problems that need solving as opposed to the latest techniques or technologies. Yes a web agency must keep up to date with all of the latest trends to remain competitive, but cultivating an entire team to become primarily business focussed is by far more valuable to an agency in the long-run than any use of cutting edge technologies as that team will consistently be delivering business value to clients and this only ever increases agency team morale.

KPIs can also serve as a boundary to client requests for features that are out of scope. In this instance, with KPIs defined, a web project manager can, with all sincerity, ask which KPI this relates too. More often than not, the answer will be none and in one swift move you have not only protected the project’s scope but kept the client focussed on their business’s primary aims and saved them money.

WHEN FAILING IS VALUABLE
Even failing to deliver on one or all KPIs is extremely valuable to a web agency because it allows the team to fully analyse why this was the case and take the appropriate steps to improve on the next project. In some instances, by being completely transparent with a client about the KPIs and failure to reach them results in a relationship based on respect and trust and this puts an agency in a great position to propose further work in order to turn the failure into success based on statistics captured post-launch – if you can identify what the project failed to achieve but also why, you can fix it rapidly.

WHO SHOULD DEFINE KPIS
It is important to specify who should create the web project’s KPIs? Usually the client will give you the KPIs but it is the web agency’s role to analyse and challenge these where necessary to ensure they are realistic, measurable and placed in the correct context e.g. if a KPI is given to as “appear on page one of Google” without the context of which keywords to appear on page one for, the KPI could be achieved by getting the client to number one for their domain name, brilliant.

Obviously this is not brilliant, but illustrates the importance of defining the right kind of KPIs.

FACTORS TO CONSIDER WHEN CAPTURING AND MEASURING KPIS
Another factor to take into consideration when defining and capturing KPIs is what the client’s business activity is that time that could impact any of the metrics collected both before and after launch.

For example, if a KPI was to increase traffic by 5%, a ‘before’ figure would be collected that gave the current traffic over a defined period, let’s say three months. Post-launch, the ‘after’ figure would be collected for the same time duration and the comparison made. But using just this one example could possibly result in skewed results if any of the following are true:

When the ‘before’ metric was taken the client had just implemented a print marketing campaign
PPC/SEM was being conducted and now is not
The ‘after’ metric is taken over a period of time when several national holidays occur
A new competitor arises on the scene before project completion
There are many factors that should be taken into considering when capturing and measuring web project KPIs. It is impossible to predict the future, but by conducting research into any external factors increases the chance of being able to produce the most equally weighted comparative metrics and thus the purest measurement for a KPI and the project’s success.

STAYING FOCUSSED ON KPIS
Once defined with the client at the start of the project, the KPIs should be documented and circulated amongst all parties that will be involved throughout the project’s lifecycle. In doing so you are immediately focussing everyone on the aims of the project. Too often in web projects the aims of the project are specified in finite detail by the client in the tender document, backed up by agency proposals and then swiftly forgotten by both sides. While this seems a little crazy, in reality, the pace and complexity of most projects, both large and small, make it difficult to focus on anything other than completion – it’s the job of the web project manager to ensure these aims are at the forefront of everyone’s mind at all times.

The most effective ways to keep KPI focus throughout a project are to:

Document them at the start of the project
Present back to the client, and any stakeholders, in a face to face meeting
Present to your team at the kick-off meeting
Include them at the top of all project documentation e.g. sitemaps, functional specifications and creative briefs
Re-iterate them verbally at the start of any new project phase e.g. site IA, development and design
Remind everyone of the KPIs when reviewing any revisions of work and citing them as reasons for your feedback and suggestions
Defining realistic and measurable web project KPIs, and keeping them at the forefront of everyone’s mind throughout a project, is not only one of the most crucial parts of a web project manager’s role, but also takes comparatively less effort than most other project tasks you will perform for what is a huge benefit to all. It keeps everyone focussed on why the project exists in the first place, acts a guide to all decision making from beginning to end and serves as a project success indicator that benefits both client and web agency.



## Assemble the Team
### Roles & Responsibilities

### Team Cohesion

Web Project Managers work in one of the fastest moving industries out there. As soon as one technology is launched and stable another new alternative is released. Web design and development trends are in constant flux, what was a cool and effective solution one day is inefficient and out-dated the next, and I bet I’m not alone when I say that each time a new project starts someone on your team will suggest using a new design trend or technology.

Add to that the nature of running a business where cash flow is critical, other projects can knock your carefully thought out plan sideways or a key client ring up with urgent requests that require resource you booked months in advance, and you have a delicate situation indeed.

While web trends and technologies evolve around us at a rapid rate and business requirements can often change on a week by week basis, a Web Project Manger will have to make constant decisions on what solutions to ultimately deliver to the client and often these decisions will not please everyone involved in the agency or project.

So who are these people and why may they not be happy bunnies?

WHO YOU MAY ANNOY AS A WEB PM
In short, as a Web Project Manager, making final decisions about which solutions to implement, the chances are at some point you will annoy absolutely everyone who is involved in projects… not an appealing part of the job, but sometimes a necessary and unavoidable one.

The Project Manager can’t ensure that they’ll be loved by everyone – nor do they want to be. They aspire to be well respected by the customer, but even that can’t always be guaranteed no matter how well they perform and manage the project. But, the Project Manager can ensure that everything that is expected of them is being performed well and if that doesn’t always do it for the customer at least it should be noticed by the delivery organization.

But before you get scared and begin to re-think that career move into web project management, let’s look briefly at what each team member generally wants from all projects.

EMPATHISE AND UNDERSTANDING
Empathy and an understanding of the business forces driving different people’s motives are key skills required by any Web Project Manager as it enables you to appreciate other perspectives when making project decisions.

Let’s take a look at the usual suspects, who they are and what they want from web projects and your web project management. *Stereotype disclaimer included afterwards.

WEB AGENCY DIRECTORS
A web agency director wants the project completed on time, on budget, to a quality level that is fitting to the web agency and with the client feeling happy, wanting more work and willing to give referrals to potential clients.

FINANCE DIRECTORS
A finance director wants the project milestones split up in such a way that cash flow/collection is maintained for the business and thus that the project is completed to schedule, on time and on budget.

WEB DESIGNERS
Web designers want to push the boundaries with each design, creating designs that make the client happy, are worthy of the web agency’s portfolio and any web design showcase site.

WEB DEVELOPERS
Web Developers want to use the latest technologies in order to implement the most efficient solution possible and keep the web agency on the cutting edge of the industry.

WEB PROJECT CLIENTS
Clients want to receive a website that is as future proof as possible and facilitates them being able to achieve their short and long-term business aims. Unless otherwise informed, they will assume the website has been built to excellent standards but probably won’t care what doctype has been used so long as it looks and works perfectly for their users.

WEB PROJECT MANAGERS
In the middle of everyone is the Web Project Manager, and he or she will want, and often be expected, to meet ALL of the expectations above. But if you work with other Web Project Managers they will want your project to run on time so that their own projects can also be on schedule.

Cool, that’s everyone nice and neatly packaged and stereotyped, so why is it not always possible to please everyone, and as a Web Project Manager, how can you try to make sure everyone’s as happy as possible?

CONSIDER, ANALYSE AND COMMUNICATE
It is vitally important to understand that, in most cases, everyone’s intentions are good! They are always geared towards delivering a great project and growing their companies!

Understanding this first fact is crucial when you’re being pulled in every direction trying to keep people happy. Failure to understand this results in a very defensive posture when challenged and that usually leads to bad things.

When you have to make a web project decision the key is to always:

Consider everyone’s perspective, goals and motives
Analyse and make a decision
Communicate why you made the decision
This sounds simple and thus you would think it easy to articulate in a paragraph, but after trying to do just that and failing quite dramatically, in much the same way as Greedo tried to apprehend Han Solo, it seems best to illustrate the point using a few scenarios Web Project Managers face every day.

DEVELOPER: “LET’S USE A NEW TECHNOLOGY”
You have the client requirements, you communicate this to the development team and you hear the phrase you know both excites and scares you…

“We could use [insert_new_web_technology_here] for that feature.” – It’s time to and make a decision.

The first step is to consider why the developer is suggesting to use a new technology as opposed to the one the agency has experience using – it will generally be for one of the following reasons:

The new technology has the potential to be far more performance efficient than the current one
Using the new technology will mean less repetitive work in the future
The developer fancies trying out (playing with) the new technology
Next a Web Project Manager should analyse if using the new technology is a decision that will improve the project, web agency and/or client’s chances of meeting their business aims.

To do this it is important to make sure you fully understand the technology in question so you can assess the potential benefits and risks.

In order to make a decision a Web Project Manager needs one or all of the following because ultimately you are 100% responsible for the project’s outcome:

Experience in the technology being put forward as a possible solution
The aptitude and willingness to research the proposed solution
Absolute trust in team members to make the right decision
Once you understand the technology, assess it against the project and decide if the long-term benefits justify going for it and then communicate your decision and reasons why to your team.

If you choose to go for it then you should communicate the possible benefits of using it to your boss and add the caveat that it is adding a certain risk to the project and thus could cause some overrun. Of course you may be overruled, but if you think it’s worth it, put your case forward and do everything you can to make sure the benefits are clearly visible.

If you choose to reject the idea you should do more than just say “no” to the development team, instead communicate to them the reasons why you are making this decision, which could include:

Using the new technology brings too much risk to what is already a fragile client relationship that needs complete stability right now
You feel the advantages of the new technology are not strong enough when compared to the current stable one you use
The new technology is not mature enough to be used on a high-profile site
The cross browser compatibility is not broad enough to warrant use
The project budget is already extremely tight
It’s quite possible that, even after explaining your reasons, team members will still be unhappy and you will get the shaking heads and sighs that translate as “This Web Project Manager is really stuck in his ways and is holding this agency back technically!” It’s at times like this you just need to have a thick skin and have absolute conviction in your decision.

As I’ve said before, as a Web Project Manager you are responsible for the entire outcome of the project and thus the client satisfaction, deadlines, budgets, agency cash flow, reputation and whole host of other business critical factors – the technical solutions provided are the complete focus of the developers, but in the grand scheme of things only one part of many and you are the one with the complete overview.

Communicating this to the development team regularly will hopefully raise their awareness to this fact and make them more commercially aware, and that can only be a good thing for any web agency.

ALWAYS PLAYING SAFE
As a little side note however, making the ‘safest’ decision is not always the best move, sometimes it’s best to just go for it even if you think the chances of success are smaller than you’d like…

This is how web agencies move forward, by occasionally throwing caution to the wind, taking risks and pushing the boundaries! If it works, you and your team are great, if it doesn’t, blame will be laid squarely with you – but hey, as a Web Project Manager you should be used to this situation right ;-) and better to have given it a go than always play safe!

MD: “WHY ARE WE GOING OVER BUDGET?”
Oh the words any Web Project Manager fears… it inherently is coupled with the assumption the project has been managed poorly and thus you should be hung, drawn and quartered. On some occasions this is exactly the case and it’s best to just admit it, learn from it and try to make sure the same mistakes aren’t made again – it happens to us all, its how we become better.

However, on the odd occasion a Web Project Manager has consciously made decisions that they knew would cause the project to overrun, but in doing so have achieved, or gone part way to achieve, a web agency’s business goal that aligns with the long-term strategy.

Examples of this include using web project tasks or phases to:

Train a team member in a new skill and/or give them experience
Develop new web project management processes
Create a stunning agency portfolio site
Develop a new re-usable plug-in for a CMS
Make a very important client very happy
Of course an agency would ideally be able to satisfy all of these requirements on a regular basis within project timelines and budgets, but let’s face it this isn’t always possible so you have to grab any opportunity you can and go for it – remember, over budget doesn’t always mean zero profit.

The important things are to consider if this is the right task, project, client account or time in the business’s life to go over budget by using your knowledge of all four to analyse the best course of action.

If your analysis leads you to the conclusion it is worth it, then communicate to the big boss man (or lady), preferably before you announce the decision to the team, that this is why you went, or are heading, over budget on this particular project, but, the agency now has a:

Trained up team member who has a new skill that can be utilised on future projects
Happy team member who feels they are growing in experience and skill
More refined and efficient web project management process
Website or web application that will ‘wow’ potential clients and makes the whole agency proud
New, or vastly improved, CMS feature plug-in that can be deployed in minutes rather than hours
Great chance for repeat account business and glowing referrals
If you can communicate the reasons you made a decision that meant your project overran and demonstrate that it will provide a potential viable amount of return on investment, more than the over budget time spent, you should get the thumbs up and it’s full steam ahead.

CLIENT: “I WANT TO ADD A NEW FEATURE”
Words from a web project client you could almost bet your life savings on hearing at least once per project and after all functionality has been agreed upon and budgeted for in terms of money and resource allocation.

However, in order to shy slightly away from the traditional Waterfall project management methodology, a Web Project Manager’s response to requests like these should never be an instant “no” because a specification has been signed off for several reasons:

They could have additional budget and be willing to extend the project’s timeline in order to fit the new feature in
Other parts of the project may be ahead of schedule and under budget, leaving room for additional work
They may be willing to sacrifice a previously agreed feature to get the new one in
There may be an alternative and quick to implement solution that will see the same aims achieved
The feature in question may be one your web agency have been thinking about developing before to sell to other clients
“No” should only ever be the words you use if after analysing the request it is deemed in no way possible
Before making any decisions a Web Project Manager should first consider why the client is asking for this feature and why now.

The common response to these requests is to huff and puff about how typical of a client this is, assume they are being cheeky and trying to squeeze the web agency as much as possible etc. But, for the most part, clients are savvy business people who know their industry, market and target audience better than you and thus the late feature request could well be a reaction to something happening in their field that makes a seemingly daft request quite a sensible one.

Start by having a discussion with the client about why they want this new feature, more importantly what business reason or web project KPI they feel it will help to satisfy.

Once you have fully considered why the client has made the request, the next step should be to analyse if the new feature:

Will help the client’s business or project aims
Can be completed under the current budget, timelines and required resources are available
Would require additional budget or timeline extension
Could be re-sold to other clients
Once you have analysed the information and made a decision, you should then communicate it to the client.

If you decide to allow the feature in the client will be over the moon and they’ll love you to bits, sweet.

If you decide that the feature should/will not be allowed in, then you will get a mixed bag of reactions depending on the client, but how you communicate this decision can influence the reaction immensely!

Take the client through your decision making process step by step, explain to them the hours you estimate the new feature would take just cannot be accommodated unless they agree to provide further funding or sacrifice another project deliverable, or how the feature would probably not in fact achieve what they would hope it too – the more transparent you are about your decision making process when communicating the decision, the more understanding you’ll generally find the client to be.

Learning how to say “no” to a client is an art form for most Web Project Managers.

GUARANTEED HAPPINESS FOR ONE AND ALL?
Web Project Managers are constantly pulled in every direction by everyone – they are always in the middle of everyone and their priorities. It requires a great deal of strength, understanding and negotiation skills to be able to deal with these pressures and end the project with all parties feeling positive – remember Web Project Managers’ motives are also always focussed on delivering value, not only for the client, but their web agency as well.

By following the consider, analyse and communicate decision making process during web projects will not always result in happiness for everyone involved, but being honest and transparent about how you reached the decision and why you believe it is the right one for the project, web agency and client should go some way to reducing any friction that could be caused otherwise.

Is it about how to manage clients? Or maybe how to spot bad clients? Or what about how to handle client meetings? You could do an article that was more client-focussed.

I then let him beat me at FIFA so he doesn’t go to bed crying. However, as much as it pains me to say it, he does make a good point.

There are an awful lot of web project management articles out there that are focussed on client management, as well as estimating, scope creep and budgets etc. but one area that is often overlooked is what part a Web Project Manager can play in team management.

My next series of articles will focus more on the internal aspects of web project management.

This article focuses on why and how a Web Project Manager should resolve common issues that cause internal team conflicts that ultimately stall web projects and lower team morale.

DYSFUNCTIONAL DIGITAL FAMILIES
Web designers hate developers, developers whine about designers and both bitch about the Web Project Managers – this is the stereotypical view of the relationship between these three parts of a web project team that resembles what social workers would undoubtedly call a dysfunctional digital family.

An old sepia picture of a man and two women in hysterics with laughterWhy can’t we just all get along like this?
The reasons for these notoriously frosty relationships have been well documented over time in articles such as:

Two Cats in a Sack: Designer-Developer Discord
Why Project Managers are a Barrier for Designers
However, as my comments in the latter article suggests, I believe the reasons for issues all boil down to four things:

Conflicting priorities
Arrogance
Lack of competence
Low awareness of the bigger picture
Guess what, these four things are here to stay and as well as having to manage multiple web projects, several clients, a handful of suppliers and even your boss to some extent – I sincerely believe it’s down to the Web Project Manager to also manage these aspects of a digital team dynamics.

As some of you may be thinking right now “Why me!?”, well here’s why…

WEB PROJECT MANAGERS: IT’S YOUR JOB
The simple answer to why it should be you, is because as a Web Project Manager you are responsible for the successful delivery of the web project and failure to manage the four issues will almost certainly result in either web project failure or a lower quality result than it could’ve been.

Not only are you responsible, but you’re often the only person with the full overview of the situation and thus are best placed to start resolution and below are some approaches to each.

CONFLICTING PRIORITIES
As a Web Project Manager you are smack bang in the middle of web projects. Your boss just wants the project to go well, the client wants what they paid for, designers want to produce something they can be proud of and developers want to create elegant efficient code that solves the problem.

A photograph of a cute little dog pulling on a bright pink toy while looking directly into the cameraYou have to manage bitches like this and their priorities
Unfortunately these priorities often clash and this is where the problems start, but the resolution approach is generally the same…

First you must understand the priorities of each party, then empathise completely, and finally educate all on everyone else’s priorities and feelings – and you have to do so in a way that leaves each party empathetic to all sides of the equation and willing to compromise.

To effectively achieve this you have to believe and champion the notion that no one is looking to screw anyone else over and all parties are just looking to produce the best thing they can – and you know what, this isn’t fantasy land, this is pretty much always the case but for some reason it’s rarely communicated.

ARROGANCE
We’ve all met them, the arrogant designer, developer and even the occasional arrogant Web Project Manager :)

They think they know it all and when challenged they see it as almost an insult, dig their heels in and seemingly set out on a mission to be as obstructive as possible to a smooth web project process.

A photograph of a bird's head as he looks all superiorLook at him, he so thinks he’s it!
However the truth is, pride and a high level of skill mixed with confidence is often mistaken for just arrogance. But whether these people are good or not is irrelevant really when it comes to eliminating this as a cause of web project problems.

Your mission is to remove barriers to momentum and get things going again and so, when faced with an arrogant team member just take them to one side and talk to them with respect about what their issues are – and when I say talk to them, really talk and more importantly listen first, and then once you’ve fully understood their issues make sure they know you’ve understood and then proceed to explain how all you want to do is move things forward.

Try offering up parallel issues that another team has with the project, try to make them appreciate it’s not just them in a bit of a situation and then finally make sure to leave the room with a deal that removes the barrier.

LACK OF COMPETENCE
Sometimes a designer will hate a developer for putting the brakes on a design element that would require certain rocket science functionality, or a developer will get annoyed with a designer because a PSD has been poorly organised – while these situations can arise due to poor communication or squeezed time, it can also be a simple case of a lack of competence.

A photograph of a white furry-faced toy with a gormless look on his face“Seriously guys, I swear I did it right this time, ya feel me?”
In either case there is one sure fire way to make matters worse and that’s to bitch and whine with either party about the other. Instead of enflaming the issue look at positive ways to solve it.

Immediately quell any slating of anyone and start to guide the conversation to a vibe of “Ok, how are we going to fix this now and make sure it doesn’t happen again”. Again, by default take the position that the person who has caused issues with low competence probably meant well and what’s needed is education not crucifixion.

Get the two parties together and facilitate a little informal session on why this element causes issues and what approach can be taken in the future to reduce them.

You’d be surprised how quickly the tone turns from spiteful and toxic to something a little more positive and constructive when a Web Project Manager gets two people together and facilitates a little education session, that leaves both parties feeling a little bit more empathetic towards the other.

LOW AWARENESS OF THE BIGGER PICTURE
Aside from conflicting priorities this is probably the most common reason for internal squabbling on digital teams and having been on the production side myself I can think back to when I was the biggest culprit.

I would build a site in superbly clean front-end code and then get annoyed when I was told there was no time to ensure the site passed a heap of accessibility checkpoints, be it through testers or by human testing – outrageous!!

A photograph of an office worker with glasses and an afro style hairstyle peeking out behind a monitor with a toy gun“Oh no you didn’t just ask me to use inline CSS!!!”
Despite meaning well and knowing what best practice was I just didn’t understand that from a commercial standpoint that there just wasn’t the budget to allow me to do this. The mistake my manager at the time made was not to explain this to me in a way I could understand – I was totally peed off and thought he didn’t care about best practice.

From experiences like this I learnt that in similar design or development situations where a Web Project Manager will make a decision that makes production teams vomit, it’s important that you communicate that you’re fully aware it’s not best practice and then move onto explain why you’ve made the decision.

It really annoys me when any management person talks about production teams as if they don’t care about the commercial side of business, or even worse, wouldn’t understand it – bullshit.

Web designers and developers are very smart people and if they’re talked to as such I’ve yet to find one that doesn’t end up appreciating why they have to ‘code it dirty’ from time to time. No, it doesn’t make them happy to do so, nor will it stop the same frustrations next time as these people have passion and pride, but it does get the job done and compliance should always be rewarded on a future web project with some breathing space to do the right thing.

I genuinely believe if a production team member seems to not care about the bigger picture, his manager or Web Project Manager has simply not found the right way to communicate it and they should keep trying before assuming the worst of the person.

SUMMARY
While there are many more common issues experienced within digital teams, the main points I wanted to get across are that as a Web Project Manager you should see it as your responsibility to try and resolve any issues that are causing problems with your web projects.

Please do not immediately go bleating to your manager or colleagues about these issues, first try and resolve them yourself.

Running to your manager each time not only puts more on their already busy plates, but it also loses you massive respect points from your team, the very people you’re meant to be leading and keeping motivated to work for you – the manager route should be your last point of call, not first.

A photograph of Lego figures in a parody set from the movie Office SpaceWeb Project Managers should never run to Lumbergh
Always start by being empathetic to Jedi levels when any issues arise. So often I see in-house fighting between two parties that turns nasty when all along both just wanted to do what they saw as the right thing – stop it before it turns nasty by genuinely (not falsely) listening and understanding the reasons for the feelings – a powerful weapon in the Web Project Manager’s arsenal is the ability to empathise where others cannot.

Make sure to resolve each conflict with education. This education could take many forms, be it on the skills front or business angle, but make sure that by the end of it all parties involved have a heightened awareness to the feelings of others and increased knowledge on how to avoid it next time.

## Make a Plan

PROJECT MANAGEMENT IS FOR CORPORATES!
You have all no doubt read countless articles on how best to plan a web project. They all go into varying amounts of detail about the steps you should take and how if you don’t follow them the whole world will fall from underneath your feet. I happen to agree with this general philosophy and can often be found preaching the same in my day job.

However, the trouble with many of these articles is they’re often written by authors who work for a large corporate and are planning a multi-million pound enterprise web projects that must use the PRINCE2 methodology and assumes you have weeks of time allocated to plan your project.

For those of us working in small web agencies, or as super funky freelancers, the reality of the web project planning process is a little different…

In this three part article I hope to fill this gap a little with my humble ramblings on pragmatic web project management, addressing why it is often skipped, what the advantages are, the two different type of planning personalities that exist and a little insight into the processes and tools I use to help me retain what sanity I have left.

WHY PLAN AT ALL?
Before talking about why it’s often skipped or how to plan, it’s important to discuss why planning is needed at all for web projects. Simply put, planning a web project allows you to:

Define and manage the project scope
Identify and minimise risks to the project
Break the allocated project time into manageable phases and tasks
Determine realistic milestones and client-side deadlines
Track progress and control the project
Secure the necessary resource
Although these points sound very much like the corporate web project management waffle I mention in the opening part of this article, they apply to web projects of all shapes and sizes. Not being able to satisfy these points at all stages of any sized project can often spell disaster.

WHY WEB PROJECT PLANNING IS OFTEN SKIPPED
It sounds obvious on paper that planning is a necessary and valuable stage of any web project, but the reality of day to day web project management in a small business, or as a freelancer, often makes it difficult to remain disciplined enough to ensure thorough planning is always conducted.

There are many reasons why planning a website project in a small agency, or as a freelancer, is quite different, they include the usual suspects:

Lack of time
Lack of web project planning skills
Lack of resource available to plan
Lack of budget
The belief planning over complicates
Web project planning is not fun
LACK OF TIME
It takes time to plan a web project, there’s no getting around it. When feeling the time and cash flow pressures, an agency or freelancer does on a daily basis, it can often feel like stalling design and development work in order to plan is just slowing things down too much, adding unnecessary time and cost to the budgets, stopping the project being completed and that essential last 50% payment coming in hitting your bank. The only real questions to ask are: Does it actually slow the project delivery down and add to the budget?

The default answers to these questions are:

“Don’t be silly, of course it doesn’t slow delivery down or add budget, it speeds it up and saves you and the client a load of cash.”

However, at the risk of undermining my own article, I’m going to say it depends… It really does depend on the web project, the web project manager, the web team and the client. In my experience planning has no negative effects but to say you will never bring a project in on budget and on time without planning is a falsehood and I discuss this in the Part 2 of this article (coming soon).

LACK OF WEB PROJECT PLANNING SKILLS
Project planning is not as easy as it looks, I personally didn’t realise this until I had to do it, and despite planning many projects still don’t feel I’m a Jedi-level web project planner. Sure I’d read some books and a whole heap of articles and tutorials, but the reality is like anything, you learn on the job and from your mistakes. Likewise, as with anything else, experience is the most valuable commodity with refining any skill.

The truth is many small agencies and freelancers do not yet possess the skills to confidently plan a web project in its entirety. While I can only implore both to start learning, I do however feel this reason is often used as an excuse to dismiss web project planning as a “waste of time” (I really have heard this said with my own, rather large, ears. I swear I almost fainted).

But I can empathise with this attitude… let’s use an obvious analogy to explain – homemade curry.

I like a curry as much as the next person, I also like to cook. I’m told making a curry from scratch is ten times better than a takeaway or using a bottled sauce. Every part of me knows this must be true and yet I don’t make one from scratch myself, why? Because it’s just not worth it… the bottled sauce is fine and tastes good – at least that’s what I tell myself and others. The truth is, to me, making a curry from scratch requires a lot of fiddling takes ages and looks really complex regardless of the rewards of a homemade one.

To the uninitiated used to not planning web projects, yet happily making a living, it can seem a little daunting to contemplate starting to plan using any processes given the stigma processes carry of being slow. Like with my curry, any new skill being used for the first few times will add a significant amount of time to the process you’re used to, you will make mistakes, perhaps a few horrific ones, but once you’ve mastered it, you’ll be quick, you’ll reap the rewards, see the benefits and wonder why you ever had such a problem with it.

Damn, now I actually want a curry.

LACK OF RESOURCE AVAILABLE TO PLAN
As I said before, planning takes time and that is something few of us can say we have in abundance. Even dedicated web project managers are all too often stacked with too many projects and too little time to plan effectively.

The only advice I can offer here is to try and shut yourself away from the world for a day or two, resist the temptation to deal with e-mail and phone calls, and plan that project. This is easier said than done, but I always try to remind myself that it’s quite possible I could’ve been ill for those two days and if I had been would have probably not moved any projects forward, dealt with e-mail or taken phone calls – what’s the difference?

LACK OF BUDGET
This is often a contentious issue because a salesman will not want to add a row in their project estimate to the client that ups their final quote price for something that isn’t a production task – however this really isn’t necessary. If you charge for web project management time, and have been a good boy or girl and been tracking project management time from previous projects in order to identify trends like web project management tends to take between 10% -20% of the total project time, you should always be able to allocate an adequate amount of time to a project timescale or estimate in order to cater for the time required to manage the project, including the planning phase.

Sorry folks, lack of project budget is just not a justifiable reason for not planning your project. If you have to, do it for free, you will undoubtedly recoup any time spent on fewer design and functionality revisions in the long-run due to the planning you did.

THE BELIEF PLANNING OVER COMPLICATES
Although you will often hear this line from the ‘dive in and get started’ planning personality mentioned in Part 2 of this article, and despite it not being a popular answer amongst the web project managers out there, the truth is they can sometimes be right.

When you’re up against the clock and the pressure is on in a small agency or freelance role, and instead choose to update your GANTT chart each time a task is delayed by 3 hours, or insist on wireframing the 404 error page, chances are you are focussing too much on the planning when you should be focussing on the doing.

That said, you also have to know when to stop to update your schedule or perform the most crucial web project management tasks so that you can maintain a level of control over your project. Not planning when you know you should is a dangerous habit to get into and trust me, before you know you have several projects all going tits up and in ten different directions and all because you chose to do when you should have planned.

Being a good web project manager in a busy small business environment means you have to be wise and flexible enough to know when to plan and when to just get on and ‘do’!

WEB PROJECT PLANNING IS NOT FUN
This heading is slightly misleading, I enjoy web project planning for two reasons:

It’s just what I happen to enjoy doing these days
It feels like a lovely warm fuzzy blanket at the beginning of a project to know you have identified the risks, broken down the project and can visualise every step, including the end
As with so many of the most critical parts of web project management, like producing detailed estimates, to most it’s just not exciting or sexy and there is only one cure – try planning your next few web projects that warrant planning before starting production and see if it seems to help or hinder.

If you do it right, remain disciplined and consistent I would wager ownership of my cat Spiderpig that you won’t look back – if I’m wrong I will personally cook you a curry from scratch…

WHY SMALL WEB AGENCIES AND FREELANCERS SHOULD PLAN THOROUGHLY
Major reasons small web agencies and freelancers should get into the habit of planning web projects thoroughly is so they can begin to develop some repeatable processes that they can rely on for every project, or even apply the skills and techniques to parts of their projects if full planning is just not possible.

If anything, I believe web project planning, in some respects, is more important to a small agency or freelancer because there is less room for mistakes given most are in a constant state of survival mode. Yes a corporate web project needs planning, but a mistake is less likely to put them out of business! In our world, and as I’ve said in previous articles, one or two whoppers of mistakes can mean the end of a business…

Melodrama aside, I believe it’s time for small web agencies and freelancers to up their game on the web project management side of things.

We are maturing as an industry at a rapid rate and I believe the days of fumbling our way through projects in our small offices or bedrooms are coming to an end.

We live in an age where clients are becoming more web savvy and quick to spot a disorganised supplier, and where they are more likely to hire, or work with again with, an agency or freelancer who can demonstrate a certain level of professionalism, competence and consistency when it comes to planning and running their projects.

In Part 2 of this article I will describe the two types of people that plan/manage web projects and the advantages and disadvantages of both, and in Part 3 I will go into more detail about the techniques and tools I use when planning web projects… stay tuned.

PLANNING PERSONALITIES
I often come across both web agencies and freelancers who consistently do not plan their web projects, and no matter how many times the same mistakes are made, they continue to push ahead using the same techniques. Once upon a time I put this down to sheer naivety, but I’ve come to realise it’s not naivety at all, it’s just that people responsible for running web projects and web project management are very different (not sure it should have taken me so long to realise this!)

A really good, if somewhat angry, article, posted by Karine, entitled “Project management and fire fighting” on Ace Project helped inspire this part of the article in the series. It summarises the two different types of web project planning personalities I talk about here; Fire Fighters and Forest Rangers.

FIRE FIGHTERS AND FOREST RANGERS
To further back up Karine’s summary I also heard a quote the other day that I found fascinating, it stated you get two types of people when it comes to planning:

Someone who doesn’t enjoy planning and just dives straight into production. These people will get started quickly and will reach the finishing line after solving many challenges as and when they arise in an ad hoc fashion (The Fire Fighter)
Someone who will start slowly, meticulously planning every step from start to finish and although will gain momentum more slowly, will usually complete the task correctly first time round (The Forest Ranger)
The extreme sportsman and the robot; the two web project planning personalities.Two planning personalities; Fire Fighters & Forest Rangers
(Ok, I realise these images show neither a Fire Fighter or Forest Ranger, but you get the meaning behind them no?)

THE TWO WEB PROJECT PLANNING PERSONALITIES
This planning personality quote fascinated me so much because my initial reaction was that the person who just dives in is clearly a little mental if they think they can successfully bring a project in on time, on budget and to a high quality by taking this approach.

But soon after hearing this quote it dawned on me that, web project management ideals aside, and speaking from the reality of running web projects in a small web agency or as a freelancer, I’ve seen it done, and not just once but on several projects at several companies.

So what does this mean? That you can plan and run web projects using either approach? Using quotes from Karine’s article, let’s take a closer look at the reasons why both web project management personalities/approaches are adopted when put in context of the frantic pace and environment we all work in today…

THE FIRE FIGHTER
Fire fighting is a management style not only used by project managers. When someone spends all their time putting out fires, they look very busy, and they have a great sense of purpose.

Although this summary has some truth, I do feel perhaps the article was perhaps written on the back of a bad experience! I say this because although I have met many Fire Fighters, I don’t believe they run web projects in this way in order to look busy or have a sense of purpose.

I believe the reasons some web project managers adopt the fire fighting approach are because they:

Have no time to plan or run a web project due to all sorts of everyday pressures such as cash flow or a large client with un-realistic and inflexible deadlines
Are suffering from web project overload – responsible for too many projects at a given time
Have a lack of web project management/planning skills and experience and don’t know any other way
Enjoy the adrenaline buzz of the unknown during projects
Don’t enjoy web project planning
Just want to get on with the production
Have had successes with the approach before
THE FOREST RANGER
While fire fighters are very visible and have a high-risk, dangerous job, forest rangers are just as important: they keep fires from starting in the first place. It’s not as glamorous as fire fighting, but it causes less damage.

I find this quote to also be mostly true, but would emphasise that I believe Forest Rangers have an equally high-risk and dangerous job given they are ultimately just as responsible for web projects as Fire Fighters.

The reasons for taking the Forest Ranger approach are mostly the exact opposite of the reasons for adopting the Fire Fighting role. A Forest Ranger will typically:

Have allocated time per project to plan web projects in detail
Be responsible for an acceptable amount of web projects at any one time thus not falling victim to project overload
Come armed with web project planning skills and experience
Have a strong dislike of project fires and emergencies and a love of predicting and avoiding them in advance
Enjoy web project planning
Believe beginning web project production work before planning is a large risk
Have had successes with the approach before
SO WHAT’S THE BEST PERSONALITY FOR WEB PROJECT PLANNING?
Well first of all it should be said that although I have discussed two different web project planning personality types, it doesn’t necessarily mean one person can only adopt one personality throughout the many projects they plan.

As a web project manager in a small agency, or as a freelancer, working to tight deadlines and on too many projects at once will inevitably lead to you at some stage having to skip the detailed planning phase. You know it’s wrong, you know it is bound to cause problems and lost time and money down the road but the reality is the project must start now! Other times you will be lucky enough, or choose to spend an evening or weekend, to have the time to plan a project in detail.

So what happens when you have to be, or are by default, a Fire Fighter? Why do those projects sometimes go well?

WHY FIRE FIGHTING SOMETIMES WORKS
As I mentioned previously, despite going against all I know to be good and true on this earth, occasionally I will see a Fire Fighter bring a project in on time and on budget and I always ask myself, how? From what I’ve seen the answer is more often by luck, with a hint of experience of running projects this way.

If you get the right project, with the right budget, right team, a good client and have many years experience of diving in and just starting on design or development, you could very well bring that project home with a gold star – it happens.

However, if even one of those variables isn’t present, you could really get caught out the minute something goes wrong and cause yourself and your team a whole load of stress… this is when the methodical and thorough planning of a Forest Ranger really proves valuable.

CONSISTENCY IS KEY
Although Fire Fighters can bring some projects in on time and on budget, others will spiral horribly out of control, and when it does, reeling it back in to a controlled state can be a nightmare because usually there has been little documentation, ambiguous or non-existent scope definition and unclear phase sign-offs.

Being a Forest Ranger by no means guarantees project success, but over time it tends to prove more stress free and consistent because many of the problems encountered along the way, and there will always be several, can be addressed quickly, comprehensively and with complete confidence.

If a Fire Fighter’s project is going over budget or running late and there has been no defined scope sign-off or project schedule, the client is well within their rights to question why and become rather unpleasant. If the same thing begins to happen in a Forest Ranger’s project, he or she, can point to how, who, what, why and when with absolute conviction – in most cases, with the full facts presented to them, a client will generally accept the situation and either compromise or provide additional funding.

Over time, a Forest Ranger’s consistent form of web project planning and management will produce consistent results when compared to that of a Fire Fighter.

There’s no way to completely guarantee success on a project. There are always issues that arise and sometimes even the tightest control and the best communication, management and resources can’t ensure success. But the probability of success is exponentially higher with well-documented and utilized Project Management processes in place.

THE PLANNING PERSONALITY HIERARCHAL TRUTH
Perhaps some Fire Fighters out there are reading this article and thinking “Oh be quiet thesambarnes you little midget, I don’t bother with the kind of planning you mention and I’m still in business!”

To this I say well done, you’ve been very lucky and long may you prosper, but I would offer the following response to you as the final piece of evidence that the Fire Fighting approach is always the second choice and thus by definition the most vulnerable…

I can absolutely guarantee each and every person that considers themselves a Forest Ranger at heart, and works in a small web agency or as a freelancer, has adopted the Fire Fighter approach on several projects during their career.

What’s interesting about this is I think the number of Fire Fighters who could honestly say they’ve adopted, and stuck to for a whole project, the Forest Ranger approach for even one project is significantly smaller – thus the following hierarchy is formed with regards to web project planning and management:

If you have the skills, experience and time to implement, the most effective, efficient and solid web project management approach is that of the Forest Ranger
If you do not have the skills, experience or time available to implement the Forest Ranger approach, the fall back is to adopt the Fire Fighter role and just get the job done as best you can
I would be open to hear any challenges on this, and change my opinion accordingly, but without a convincing challenge I think this role reversal comparison, and truth that Fire Fighting, although occasionally successful, happens when a crucial skill or variable is lacking from a web project manger’s toolkit, ultimately places the two approaches in a hierarchal order rather than on a level footing.

EXAMPLE SMALL WEBSITE BRIEF
Let’s take the following common brief to a small agency or freelancer as our example scenario.

“Hey web nerdy geek person, I own a one man band catering business. I want a small website so people can find me, view my menus and book my services online. I want to be able to update the website content myself, edit my menus, upload images to the menu gallery and receive orders via e-mail. I’d like to launch in 4 weeks and have a £3000 budget.”

Notice I omitted the requirement to be number one on Google for the keyword “food”. This would clearly cost at least another £1000.

PLANNING? PAH, NO NEED, NO TIME – BORING!
Ah (I hear you say), a small simple website, could probably get started on designing the homepage straight away, let’s get it on!!!

The truth is, yes, you could dive straight into your sketchbook or Photoshop and get designing, but what will go on the homepage exactly? At this point you could guess based on, what is usually, a slightly woolly set of initial meeting notes. But the reality is you just don’t know and the chances are you will spend time on several revisions of the homepage and it’s widgets until you get the client’s approval.

If you get it right first time then you got lucky or you’re a psychic web designer (If psychic please contact me for immediate employment opportunity).

By diving in and getting the homepage approved by the client you will have used a certain amount of project time, but how much did you have allocated for the homepage design and what date should it have been signed off by in order to remain on track for launch?

If you don’t know the exact answers to these questions your project is already out of control.

Despite this, you press on and get approval for all design, hooray! You begin to start the functional phase of the project only to discover the client wants a rotating banner on the homepage and wants to be able to do a whole host of other things dynamically that when designing you had envisaged being static elements – oh the pain of re-opening the design phase of the project after ‘approval’.

But, what about if you choose to hold off from the production side of things and start with some project planning…

PRAGMATIC WEB PROJECT PLANNING
Ok, so the above scenario is a little exaggerated to illustrate the point, but I challenge anyone, and I include myself, to deny they’ve ever found themselves in a similar situation with a web project, I know I have and no doubt will again!

The web project planning processes described below are not intended to the be a definitive set of web project management techniques that align with the classic project management methodologies, but a stripped down version that I personally find practical on a day to day basis when trying to juggle the realistic amount of work and lack of time we all have.

For the freelancer this may seem all a bit too much to consider doing, but I can assure you, once you get to grips with it you can knock out all of the processes in a solid day or two for projects ranging from small to medium and it will inevitably save you a lot more days in the long run!

DEFINING SCOPE, IDENTIFYING RISKS AND GRANULAR PROJECT TASKS
If you estimated the web project using a method similar to the one I described in my Estimating Time for Web Projects more accurately series you already have a head start as you have a complete breakdown of all the design and functional requirements, along with timescales. If not, don’t panic, you can retro fit the method based on the budget and deadline as follows:

Speak at length with the client and break the project down into all design and functional requirements, getting as granular as possible for both
Document any assumptions you have to make about the project due to lack of information e.g. the client will perform all content entry and provide all images
Estimate times for all tasks and see how the totals match with the budget and deadline.
If your estimates put you over on both, begin to work with the client to agree on dropping or simplifying design and features until you are both happy
Enter the agreed tasks and times into your time tracking tool
By going through this initial exercise with the client you have immediately gained a great deal of control over your project before you’ve even thought about starting that all important homepage design by:

Defining the project scope, at a high-level, allowing you to manage any scope creep throughout by being able to identify any feature requests as ‘new’ by it not being present in the task list
Identified some of the project risks in terms of features that are complex
Broken the project down into granular tasks, knowing how long you have to complete each one
Now you have all of this defined information you can continue with the web project planning process, starting with the project schedule.

PRODUCING A PROJECT SCHEDULE
Using the agreed estimated times and deadline you can now produce a project schedule. Using a simple, free and open-source tool like Planner; define your web project start date, enter all of the project tasks you have identified, with the exact amount of time allowed for each. PM tools like Planner will automatically assign each task with a start and end date.

Screenshot of Planner - a great free and open-source project management tool.Planner: Create a project schedule & even export as HTML
One of the advantages of using a tool that allows you to produce a GANTT chart, with start and end dates for phases and tasks, is that you can add:

Client tasks
Revision time
Dependencies
Lag
Resource allocation
Project milestones
Dependencies? Lag? Ewww, web project management waffle! But even if you don’t plan your web projects thoroughly you will need to deal with all the above during the project – being prepared for these in advance is the magic!

CLIENT TASKS AND REVISION TIME
One thing your granular project breakdown will often not include, because it’s not something you need to estimate on in order to produce a quote, is the tasks the client must complete throughout the project and the revision mini-stages you have to expect to go through before sign-off of any phase or task. At this stage you need to include them, not only for your sake but also the clients’.

This means adding tasks such as:

Client homepage design review
Homepage design revisions
Client homepage design sign-off
Client copywriting
Despite these tasks being either encapsulated in your quote as ‘Homepage design’, or not at all (client copywriting), when producing a project schedule it is crucial to consider them all as they impact the overall project timeline. For example, if you have determined you only have 3 days to complete the homepage design phase, by adding in review and revision times you can communicate to the client that, in order to hit the deadline and keep the project on schedule, they must be available to review, provide feedback, sign-off and deliver website copy on/by certain dates.

Often a client seeing the turnaround time required from them, when comparing with their busy schedule, can illustrate the realism of hitting their go-live date and open up an adult dialogue that will see an extension allowed.

Note that this is still before you have put pen to paper and started a sitemap or designing the homepage – this is hardcore client expectation setting right at the beginning of the project and in the right way, as opposed to 2 weeks before go live when print campaigns have been booked!

DEPENDENCIES
Dependencies are simply rules that state Phase / Task A cannot begin until Phase / Task B is complete. Typical examples being:

Sub-page design task cannot start until the homepage design task has been completed
Back-end development phase cannot begin until the Solution Design phase has been signed off by the client
Dependencies are a great way to adjust project schedules and set client expectation when the inevitable delays happen because, taking the functional specification / back-end development example, if a delay occurred either yours or the client’s side and the functional specification overran, you could update the expected end date and the tasks / phases that are dependent on the specification being signed off will automatically shift along the calendar thus producing new milestone and go-live dates.

Of course, shifting milestone and go-live dates is never ideal, but if you can consistently explain to a client why the dates have moved, or at least communicate, when delivering the project schedule, that if you don’t get sign-off or receive content by this date, then the dependent tasks will be shifted to later dates, they will generally be more receptive to any changed timelines.

LAG
Lag is the term associated with the amount of time expected between tasks. For example, although you may have an allocated time of 8 hours for the homepage design, it is unrealistic to schedule in 8 hours or 1 day for this task. Instead you would schedule:

3.5 hours for a first version that you send to the client
A lag of perhaps 1 day that the client will need in order to review and submit feedback
2 hours revision time before re-sending to the client for review
Another 1 day of lag to allow the client time to provide feedback
The remaining 2.5 hours for final amends before sending for sign-off, and finally
1 day to allow for the client final review and actually getting around to formally signing off the design
As you can see, this 8 hour task could actually take up to 6 days to complete. It still surprises me how often I see an 8 hour task scheduled in for 1 or even 2 days and the constant shock when it actually takes a week or longer.

Then again, although I may have developed an aptitude for this lesson, I still regularly find myself in the McDonalds drive through and then gasp in disbelief as my jelly belly expands…

RESOURCE ALLOCATION
This is a huge topic in its own right. GANTT chart tools allow you to assign each project task to a team member. However, this being an article about pragmatic web project management in a small web agency or as a freelancer I will not go much further on this topic. I find simply assigning tasks to the appropriate internal team and client an adequate solution. It tells me what resource I need and when, and also rubber stamps the client’s initials against any tasks they need to complete e.g. reviews, providing content and sign-off.

MILESTONES
Milestones can be assigned to any project phase, but are generally used to define the beginning or end of a high-level project phase e.g. Design complete, Back-end development begins etc. These are the big dates to watch out for as hitting them all means you’re on track to complete the project on time.

Creating a GANNT chart that breaks down the project into as much detail as possible, adding time estimates, dependencies and lag, results in clear start and end dates for each task and phase, and ultimately produces definitive dates for the project milestones.

WHY GANTT CHARTS WORK FOR ME
GANTT charts are the subject of much debate in the project management world, some people love them and some hate them. You will find endless conversations online arguing how they are old fashioned and enforce a Waterfall methodology.

I am by no means saying they are the ultimate solution and you should never move away from them, all I am saying here is that at this moment in time they work for me on the kinds of projects I work on currently.

They allow me to:

Explain the web project lifecycle to the client
Schedule a realistic timeline with milestones that are visible to everyone
Communicate to the client their level of involvement and when they need to be available
Track the project’s progress at a low-level
Quickly adjust the project schedule and produce new milestone dates if anything overruns
Highlight the fact I need to secure more resource in order to meet the original dates
Need I sell it more? This stuff sells itself…

THE REWARDS OF WEB PROJECT PLANNING
So you’ve gone through this, sometimes painfully slow and methodical, web project planning process – how does it help you?

Cast your mind back to the advantages of planning defined in Part 1 of this article and see how this approach has satisfied each point:

Define and manage the project scope
Completed and possible through granular project breakdown
Identify and minimise risks to the project
Completed through granular project breakdown, assumption listing and scheduling
Break the allocated project time into manageable phases and tasks
Completed through granular project breakdown
Determine realistic milestones and client-side deadlines
Completed through project scheduling
Track progress and control the project
Possible with an easily updatable project schedule and consistent time tracking tasks
Secure the necessary resource
Easy to identify using an easily updateable schedule
Being able to manage these fundamental web project management factors greatly increases your chances of delivering on budget and on time without having to compromise on quality which equals happy you and happy client!

IN SUMMARY
When working in a busy environment, as either a web agency team member or as a freelancer, where delivery is what gets you paid, justifying a non-production / non-billable day or two to plan the project is pretty hard to do. Some people know it should be done and just can’t carve out the time, others don’t really believe planning in that much detail is necessary.

Those that can’t find the time should probably try to track the time they spend during their projects working on tasks that they wouldn’t have to if they had planned first – usually this time is much greater than the time it would’ve taken to plan.

Those that don’t believe planning in detail is necessary have probably had a few successes where a project was bought in on time and on budget without a planning stage, or are just avoiding admitting the fact that they don’t enjoy planning. Admitting you don’t enjoy planning is fine, not everyone does, but while admitting this, please try to also admit how many projects have not been delivered on time or budget that perhaps could’ve been if only you’d planned thoroughly.

Always skipping web project planning is a hit and miss affair where success is more dependent on the project and client rather than your ability as a web project manager.

Consistent and thorough web project planning generally results in a more consistent success rate with web projects because, before production begins, you are able to identify, define, and thus manage the critical parts of any project; phases, tasks, resource, timelines, milestones and risks and communicate these to the client.

Thorough web project planning does not ensure a project will come in on time or on budget, but it does increase the chances, and if over budget and late, it will also limit the extent the project overruns because while you may have missed or underestimated a few tasks or risks at the planning stage, you will have identified many more that you have managed to successfully control – and anything you missed this time, you can easily make sure you don’t the next time.

To the web project managers out there, some of the advantages and methods described in this article will be nothing new, but, to web agency and freelance guys and girls with little web project management and planning experience, I hope it explains why planning web projects is so important, to both supplier and client.

But primarily I hope it shows that planning a web project is not a dark art that should only be tackled by dedicated web project managers, it’s something anyone can do as long as you can mentally envisage the project from start to finish…

The real dark art is actually being able to determine the appropriate level of planning that should be undertaken for each project and then managing the project to that plan once in full swing!

So, I open up the floor to you guys…

### Time

A GOOD FOUNDATION
After reading Alyssa Gregory’s recent article on Sitepoint.com, How to Estimate Time for a Project, I couldn’t help but feel that it was a good introduction but lacked a little when compared with the realities and complexities of estimating/quoting for a website or web application.

But before we look at how to create more accurate estimates for web projects, it’s important to look at the reasons why this area is such a difficult one and why web project management forums aren’t exactly littered with posts entitled “How can I stop completing web projects on budget?”

WHY UNDERESTIMATING IS SO COMMON
There are many common reasons why web projects are often underestimated by freelancers and web agencies alike, they include the following:

The technologies required have never been used before
Large parts of the project are grey areas at the time of estimating
The features needed are very specific to the client’s industry and thus bespoke
To break the project down into the detail it would require almost as much as work as the paid for requirements gathering phase
While almost all web folk will admit to these points being common reasons why it’s difficult to estimate time for web projects, there are a few that will admit to the following that are just as true:

No previous project ‘estimated vs. actual’ analysis has been conducted to draw on
The client needs an estimate for their large project tomorrow
The revenue needs for immediate cash flow now outweigh the effects of no new business now
Estimating time for a project is not fun
I am no different. At one point or the other I have cited the valid public reasons but also fallen foul of the not so public ones; this is the reality of working as an insanely busy freelancer, or in an equally busy web agency, just trying to keep your head above the water financially.

However, there are few worse feelings in this industry than getting to any point in a project and realising you’ve grossly underestimated the time, it’s a bitter taste you don’t forget in a hurry and should strive to avoid again.

So why does it happen time and time again?

THE DAY-TO-DAY REALITY
The approaches to creating more accurate estimates for web projects that I will describe in Part 2 of this article explain how to combat several of the common reasons for underestimating. I personally use them to track time on all projects and use the data gathered when estimating new ones – the results are very positive indeed.

However, as you can see below, it doesn’t resolve them all:

The technologies required have never been used before
Large parts of the project are grey areas at the time of estimating
The features needed are very specific to the client’s industry and thus bespoke
To break the project down into the detail it would require almost as much as work as the paid for requirements gathering phase
No previous project ‘estimated vs. actual’ analysis has been conducted to draw on
The client needs an estimate for their large project tomorrow
The revenue needs for immediate cash flow now outweigh the effects of no new business now
Estimating time for a project is not fun
So what can you do to combat each of these realities?

TECHNOLOGIES HAVE NEVER BEEN USED BEFORE
If you are estimating time needed to implement a solution using a technology you have little or no experience of, you will have to conduct some basic research and then just guess! Alternatively, try to negotiate a smaller fee with which you can conduct the first stages of the project in terms of research and putting together some kind of high-level specification for the project.

At best, you learn a new technology, build a rapport with the client and win the remaining work. At worst, you’ve learnt a new technology, you’ve generated revenue and the client has a good specification to update its project tender with.

DETAILED ESTIMATION EXERCISES TAKE TOO LONG
My personal approach takes time, much more than the traditional method of providing an estimate purely based on both experience and instinct. What if you spend hours or days putting together this detailed quote, breaking the project down perfectly, and then don’t win the work. Is that a loss of opportunity on another potential sale? Does the client now have a free detailed breakdown for free?

Well yes, but this is just how it goes in any sales situation. Is it wasted work? Possibly, but it’s also possible you have researched a new technology or broken down a feature you haven’t used before. What’s to stop you trying to sell this to existing or new clients if it aligns with their long-term business aims?

CLIENT NEEDS ESTIMATE FOR LARGE PROJECT TOMORROW
If a client needs an estimate for a large project tomorrow, please refer to the ball park figure section in Part 2 of this article. Try to confirm a ball park figure and then assess the potential gains to your business versus the possibility of underestimating this one project. Always bear in mind, the larger the project, the greater the likelihood you will underestimate and the potential loss you could incur by submitting a low estimate.

BUSINESS REVENUE NEEDS
Revenue needs of a freelancer or small businesses for cash flow is an ever present issue. A typical dilemma faced is:

We need £20k in revenue this month to sustain the business
Client is offering us a maximum of £10k now and we don’t have many other leads
We feel their project will cost a minimum of £15k
We can walk away now and not lose £7k, but also not make £10k
We can take the project on and try and do it for £10k
We can take the project on; accept the £5k loss, break even and live to fight another day
This quandary is the reality of running a business and just one of the daily tough decisions a freelancer or Managing Director has to make, I don’t envy them. What to do in this situation is entirely the business owners decision, all you can do is get accurate information to them so that they can make as informed a decision as possible.

ESTIMATING TIME FOR A PROJECT IS NOT FUN
Well never has a truer word been spoken. Despite taking so much pride in it, and also testing new ways to improve accuracy, it’s not often a person will love the process of compiling and delivering a project estimate (if you find one, grab hold of them and lock them in your office!).

Let us speak plainly my friends; the following facts are true when it comes to estimating web projects:

It’s hard work and takes you outside your comfort zone
Forces you to predict the future
Usually has to be completed alongside your plans for your already fully booked week
Makes you largely responsible for the:
Sales success
Solution offered
Eventual profitability of the project
Growth/survival of your business
With all of the above being truisms that I believe most people who have to estimate web project feel, the scary truth of the matter is getting it wrong just a few times can leave a freelancer or small web agency in real turmoil.

IDENTIFY THEN FIX
For all of the reasons stated above, getting people who are primarily from a creative or technical background and more passionate in actually creating something, to really spend time on developing a solid and reliable web project time estimating process is quite difficult and understandably so, it’s just not sexy work.

But, especially in these turbulent times, being able to identify any gaps in your entire web project management workflow that (incoming buzzword bingo phrases) minimise project risk and maximise project profit should take a front seat, and the web project estimation phase is the most crucial in achieving these aims.

In Part 2 of this article I will go into detail of how I personally go about estimating time for web projects, both on an individual project and long-term multiple project basis, that combats the remaining common reasons for underestimating.

ESTIMATING PROJECTS AND THE OCCULT
After reading Alyssa Gregory’s recent article on Sitepoint.com, How to Estimate Time for a Project, I couldn’t help but feel that it was a good introduction but lacked a little when compared with the realities and complexities of estimating/quoting for a website or web application.

The Devil is in the detail: When people say that the devil is in the detail, they mean that small things in plans and schemes that are often overlooked can cause serious problems later on.
Using English.com

I may not believe in the Devil, but I do believe this statement to be as true as it gets when it comes to estimating time for web projects.

ESTIMATING WEB PROJECTS ACCURATELY
Some would say this is an oxymoron, and to some extent I would agree, but I do believe by applying a few techniques it’s possible to drastically increase the accuracy of most web project estimates and avoid the feeling of wanting to curl up in the foetal position and whimper helplessly under your duvet.

CONFIRM A BALL PARK FIGURE
Before you embark on any detailed estimate exercise it’s crucial to immediately confirm with the client a rough budget, or budget range, they feel would be acceptable for an estimate. After all, if you get a new business lead, spend three days estimating and deliver a proposal worth £30,000 only to hear that the client ‘appreciates your response’ but only has £3000 to spend, you probably deserve to be struck with reasonable force in the baby-making department.

When you receive a project brief, throw some figures out there for the client to comment on, only one of a possible few things will happen:

They will laugh and hang up when they hear your daily rate
You will laugh and hang up when you hear they want Facebook for £4000
They will say you’re in the right area but probably need to come down or go up a little bit
They will refuse to feedback and say “We are open to suggestions”
For these possibilities what the next steps are need little explanation, but the “we are open to suggestions” answer is always the trickiest. In these cases it really is down to you to make a decision if the project is worth the risk of spending time writing a proposal and estimating for. It could be that the potential for new work is huge, or the client is extremely high profile and thus often it’s worth it, however, if you feel none of these are true, you should probably ask yourself what this statement says about the client and if you want to work with them.

It’s understandable a client wants to get their website or web application at the lowest cost, but the best clients are the most professional, experienced and ethical ones and simply know that not providing a rough budget range could waste theirs and your time.

Assuming you have made the decision to pursue the lead, you can now begin the detailed estimating exercise.

CONSISTENT PROJECT PHASE BREAKDOWNS
Most web projects can be broken down into the following high-level categories:

Research and planning
Solution design
Functional specification
Web design
Front-end development
Back-end development
Content entry
Each individual project will contain unique tasks, but most can be encapsulated in the above phases.

The first step to increasing accuracy of web project estimates is to make sure you always begin with a consistent set of categories and then add as many sub-categories and tasks as you like.

GET GRANULAR, THEN GET MORE GRANULAR
Now your consistent high-level project phases are defined, it’s time to get granular and add sub-phases and tasks e.g.:

Research and planning
Requirements gathering
Project planning
Solution design
Sitemap
Wireframes
User workflows
Functional specification
Design
Initial homepage look and feel
Content page
Master content page template
News main page
News item
Front-end development
Template x5 XHTML/CSS
Cross-browser fixes
Back-end development
CMS Setup and configuration
News feature
Contact us form
Content entry
This full list of required project tasks can be created based on the pre-sales research you have conducted with the client. It is imperative to nail down, in as much detail as possible, what exactly the client wants before you submit an estimate or begin work.

The more granular you can get, the more you are forced at this early stage to think through each part of the project, literally designing and building the website or application from beginning to end in your head.

By going through the project step-by-step, putting yourself in the shoes of the information architect, the designer and all developers, will often immediately result in many issues rearing their head that you need to clarify before putting in an estimate, take the News feature for example. Ideally you could break each feature down as much as you can, so the News feature may actually end up looking like the following:

News feature
Add/edit/delete new item
Upload image
Attach PDF
Auto-archiving
RSS
By resisting the temptation to just think “News… ummm… 5 hours” and breaking it down to this level means you’re mentally building the feature step-by-step and raising questions as you go.

So the client needs to be able to upload images to their news items, ok, but do they need:

Auto-resize capability?
Auto-thumbnail generation?
Full-screen viewing?
Caption addition facility?
I’m sure you can think of many more questions that could be associated with a simple upload image for a news item requirement. This demonstrates the possible scope variations that are contained within even the smallest of features and that could impact your estimates / risk of underestimating.

By getting granular and mentally trying to build the solution you are able to identify and address these issues early on, making sure to cater for them in your final estimate.

A Web Project Manager knows how to design and develop most of the project on his own, even if with poorer results compared to his team. This allows him to estimate projects with good approximation and to understand his team’s problems and difficulties
Introduction to Web Project Management: Fucina Web

GRANULARITY: GOOD FOR THE CLIENT AND GOOD FOR YOU
Don’t forget, by getting this granular not only increases your estimations accuracy, but it also gives you the instant ability to remove proposed features quickly if your estimate exceeds the client’s maximum budget! Need to shave 10 hours off the budget? Well, rather than removing the News feature entirely, how about remove the thumbnail and caption adding functionality from News, and a few other small niceties from other features and still allow the client to have the basic versions of all the features they need? Simply remove the lines and hey presto, a new estimate at warp speed and with full visibility to the client of what functionality they’re sacrificing for budget.

Roughly guessing the News feature will take 5 hours is one thing, but what about when the client comes to you after seeing the initial functional specification and asks where the archive section is or how they attach PDFs simply because they assumed the News section they would be getting is like the News section on another website they’d seen?

Getting granular will not always allow you to breakout a required feature in full because it is client industry specific. If you are ever in any doubts about what the client needs, ASK THEM! Take the time to understand their business so that you can fully understand why they want the feature and how it needs to work.

Few clients mind you asking questions, if anything it tends to give them more confidence that you will continue to be as diligent and thorough if they hire you.

Best of all, if you win the work, by getting granular you have:

An instant statement of work
A defined project scope
The timings you need to put together an accurate project schedule with milestones
Set your client’s expectations very early
Demonstrated your thoroughness and understanding of their business to the client
By being methodical, transparent and getting granular from the very start means your client is well informed and you’re seriously reducing the chances of friction later down the line.

YOU WON THE WORK W00T! TIME TO START TRACKING TIME
The more projects you complete that are categorised with a consistent set of phases and tasks, the more useful data you can collect on how long you estimated versus how long each phase or task actually took.

Consistency here is the key again. By this stage you should have the final project estimate that was approved by the client, and this estimate should be broken down first into the same high-level phases as your previous projects, and then at a granular level by task and sub-task.

Simply replicate this structure and the time estimates for each in your time tracking tool of choice so that you can:

See how long you have to complete each phase
View how long you have for each task and sub-task
At the end, report on how long everything took
Not only is this a perfect way to track the progress of the project you are working on, but the data you collect over multiple projects, using a consistent pattern, will become more and more valuable when it comes to estimating future projects and also allow you to identify bottlenecks in your project processes.

ANALYSE PROJECT ESTIMATES VS. ACTUAL TIME SPENT
Once you have defined a consistent set of high-level project phases to use when estimating all web projects, and committed to setting up your time tracking tool each time to match, you are ready to reap the rewards.

By tracking all the estimated and actual times of all past projects, using a consistent framework, will give you an average percentage that each phase and task took, and you can use these averages as a good guide for starting a new estimate.

For example, by collecting data for your past five projects you are able to identify trends like:

Solution design took around 10% of the total project time to complete and get approved
Web design 30%
Front-end development 15%
Back-end development 30%
And so on…

Using these averages, and with a client’s preferred budget, you can begin to immediately allocate a rough amount of time to each phase and then break out each in more detail, but with the roughly allowed hours available known beforehand.

With this initial capped time limit in place, you can estimate not only your times but also the most cost-efficient solution you can deliver based on the budget rather than going in with a blind quote that may be way to small or too high.

Of course, this is dependent on knowing the client’s budget beforehand, not always possible, but more possible than most seem to think if you just explain you want to deliver the best solution for the budget given that you could potentially offer a News feature that costs £750 or £7,500.

GET GRANULAR WITH FEATURES, AGAIN!
Aside from being able to determine the average percentage of time each high-level phase usually takes of each project, you can take this tracking and analysis one step further.

How many websites or web applications tend to need a feature you’ve implemented before? Small to medium business websites invariably demand the following functionalities:

News
Press Releases
Case Studies
Events
FAQ
Contact us form
At the estimating stage you will have identified these requirements and broken them down as much as you can. Not only can you re-use these common breakdowns in multiple quotes, if you track the time for each one over multiple projects you will also begin to have average times it takes to implement or migrate each feature – now that’s useful.

IN SUMMARY
The approach for estimating time for web projects I have described to you in this article works for me. It’s something I’ve developed over several years through trial and error by having to estimate web projects of all shapes and sizes in a small web agency environment, combined with a lot of good old fashioned hours of research.

Its methodical, it’s laborious, isn’t a guarantee that a project will not go over budget and I’ve no doubt is something I will continue to develop and evolve as time goes by. But as any web project manager will tell you, the more you plan, the more chance there is your project will be successful and the same goes for estimating times.

When possible, resisting the temptation to throw some figures onto a proposal and send it off and instead splitting the project requirements into as granular detail as possible can really be a life saver. It not only identifies possible grey areas early on but forces you to think through everything you’re planning on offering the client and to what extent/scope.

It also presents you to the client as someone, or as an agency, who are very meticulous, diligent and thorough in how they approach things and this is often taken as a signifier of how you will approach the rest of the project and this always gives the client confidence.

Finally, by creating and maintaining a consistent pattern of high-level phases and tasks between your web project time estimates and time tracking means you can collect and analyse reliable data from multiple projects that can help you further increase the accuracy of, and cut the time needed to create, estimates for web projects.

### Setting things up

WEB PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND COLLABORATION USING GITHUB
- January 13, 2014 - by thesambarnes, in Digital Project Management, with 9 comments -

Holly is a Certified Scrum Master and Agile Project Manager at Award winning web agency White October. We’re currently recruiting a new Project Manager to join the team, feel free to get in touch if you’re interested. You can find Holly on Twitter @ProjectDavis.
A year ago, I had never heard of GitHub and now I’m using it on several of my biggest projects and to my surprise, enjoying doing so!

A cropped version of the GitHub 404 page banner showing it's Octocat character dressed as ObiWan from Star Wars in a desert scene in front of a land speeder and hut.It’s worth using GitHub if only for this each time you type with chubby fingers.
It started just under a year ago when I asked my project team what their preference would be for tracking issues, and the developers were almost evangelical about GitHub. I was aware that most of our active projects were being hosted and deployed from GitHub but didn’t realise it could be used for managing projects too!

So, we took the leap and instead of introducing something new into the mix we started using it to manage tasks, releases and bugs.

The results have far exceeded my expectations, i’ve seen some of the best examples of team collaboration between client, UX, developers, testers and PM, even users have used it to raise bugs or enhancements they’d like to see. This is invaluable for the product owner, who is able to respond to clients directly and add enhancements to the backlog and prioritise accordingly.

Using labels you can create issues for “discussion” i.e. we need a comment system, here are the options giving everyone visibility over the options and the opportunity to comment and be involved with the solution.

A screenshot of low-fi sketches uploaded to GitHubIf I was the client I’d totes sign this off.
GitHub wins on simplicity and its clean interface. Even some of our designers have adopted it for presenting low fidelity sketches to the client / team to review. It’s great to have communication in one centralised place rather than across emails and visible to all the team. You can set up email notifications when people comment or tag you in an issue.

It has also given me more visibility on work in progress. In our daily ODI scrums we have even introduced the reviewing of pull requests. This helps limit work in progress by ensuring pull requests are reviewed, merged and closed. If the same PR is there several days running, it can quickly alert you that something is wrong that you wouldn’t normally be able to pick up on as a non technical PM.

However, like any tool there are a couple of drawbacks. I have had to continue using spreadsheets to track time and velocity over sprints, as you can’t add estimates or track time spent on the issues themselves. However you can assign a milestone to tasks within a sprint which will give you a % indicator of tasks completed but isn’t that helpful if the one task you’ve not completed equates to half the sprint!

Lastly, there is no easy way to prioritise issues. For ODI we’ve added priority 1 and priority 2 tags which work well but i’d like the open issues to work more like a physical backlog where you can click and drag issues to prioritise.

In conclusion, I would recommend using GitHub to other Project Managers, particularly if you’re happy to track project progress outside of GitHub and just embrace it for the ace collaboration tool it is.

If you’re thinking of using GitHub you may want to look at Huboard, a lightweight Kaban board which integrates with GitHub issues.

If that doesn’t fulfil your requirements you may find something that does on this Quora question “Which project management tools are deeply integrated with GitHub?”

Not convinced yet? Why not do some further reading, here are couple of other great blog post on the topic.

### Performance Budget

### Communication

n element of one of my recent Smashing Magazine articles, Guidelines for Successful Communication with Clients, proved to be of particular interest to a lot of readers, the weekly web project status report for clients.

So here’s a little (well, a lot) more on why they work, what should be in them and a few tips on producing them.

WHY A WEEKLY WEB PROJECT REPORT?
Well first of all it should be said that a web project report does not necessarily have to be compiled and sent to the client on a weekly basis, however I believe this only applies to large projects with big budgets that are spanning over more than six months, but even then the web project report should be sent out once every other week at least!

But let’s assume we’re all talking about your bog standard website or web application project (if there is such a thing), isn’t sending a weekly web project a little too over the top?

Well quite frankly, no.

I’ve lost count of the number of times this approach has made certain conversations with clients infinitely easier, which I’ll explain below, but there are other beneficial reasons too.

CONVEYS PROFESSIONALISM
When it comes to web industry (or any industry for that matter) there are varying quality levels amongst us suppliers, some great and some absolute cowboys – a key part of maturing as a business is to make clients feel looked after to the point where they give you repeat business and referrals to others.

A 1970's style photograph of a man with an oversized foam cowboy hat on sitting on the sofaI’ll build you a website pilgrim
Achieving these key points come from a multitude of factors but consistently coming across as professional when it comes to web project management is one of the most important.

You can deliver the most amazing looking or functionally cutting edge product to your client, but if the road to that delivery leaves the client feeling anything less than 100% confident in your approach to business in general, they could very well think twice before giving you more work or staking their reputation with peers by recommending you.

You’d be surprised how organised ‘paperwork’ (or lack thereof) can influence a client’s impression of you – weekly web project reports contribute to that professional approach that is not only beneficial for you but also your agency.

INTERNAL WEB PROJECT STATUS COMMUNICATION
As you’re going to all that trouble of compiling this ‘easy to digest’ web project report, why not send it to your boss and project team also. By all rights it will contain exactly the information both of them should be interested in and you need to keep them regularly updated on.

HIGHLIGHTS ISSUES
For anyone involved in running web projects you know that on a daily basis any number of issues can rear their ugly head no matter how well it was planned. The weekly web project report can highlight these issues and instigate the conversations that need to happen in order to find a solution.

One benefit of this approach is that all issues are collected and communicated at one time rather than via several conversations at different times and by different means. This is often a more efficient way of dealing with issues and has the added bonus of acting as a high-level ‘in writing’ web project issue log that both you and the client can be held accountable for.

WEB PROJECT SCHEDULE VISIBILITY
It should go without saying why everyone involved in a web project would want a regularly updated understanding of if it’s ahead, on or behind schedule and why. But all too often I see one or two project schedules created (as I described in Part 3 of my Pragmatic Web Project Planning series), in the proposal and for the kick-off meeting, and that’s it for a while – this is a mistake.

What often happens next is milestones are dated, the work begins and the schedule is not communicated again to the client until the first milestone is approaching, which could be weeks from the start of the project – and as we all know, a lot can happen in web projects on a daily basis, let alone weeks.

An image showing two Star Wars toy Stormtroopers presenting an idea on a whiteboard for a solar powered Death Star to toy Darth Vader toy figureSelling a project is only the first part of a successful project
There are clear benefits to providing a weekly schedule update for agency and client alike.

For both parties it provides the obvious view into the status of the project’s progress and allows decisions to be made on a regular basis that allows for the smoothest path to completion, including needing to secure more resource or de-prioritise requirements to stay on track.

But crucially for the agency and client, a weekly update will aid any conversations that need to be had with regards to schedule revisions, as opposed to ringing the client weeks after starting and trying to explain why you need an extension to a particular phase or task.

As with web project budgets discussed below, if a client is updated on a weekly basis, any changes to the initial project schedule are far easier to sell if they’ve been fully aware of the road that led to this request.

WEB PROJECT BUDGET VISIBILITY
The web project budget update again is pretty self-explanatory and project management 101, but the real benefit of providing regular budget updates is best seen when, like with schedule, budget revisions are needed.

Again, you’ll find it far easier to negotiate additional funding if the client has received a weekly update on budget and was always kept informed of any phases or tasks that were potentially running over, and why – as opposed to if you get to 90% of your design budget after allowing more changes than you wanted and then suddenly drop the “we need more money” line.

With web project schedules and budgets, the key thing to understand is at the start of a project they should both be thought of as ‘initial’ and that only at the end of the project will you know the actual!

Its how you navigate to those ‘actual’ numbers, how happy the client is at the end and how effective your solution has been that really are the true measures of a successful web project.

I’ve witnessed web projects where the solution was delivered a week or two late and only a little over budget, but where the client was left feeling thoroughly in the dark and unloved and thus it felt like a failed project.

However I’ve also seen instances where timelines overran by months and budgets doubled, but because the client had been kept well in the loop and understood along the way why these situations had happened, they were happy bunnies by the end and this was a successful project.

ACTIONS ENCOURAGE MOMENTUM AND ACCOUNTABILITY
Part of the weekly web project report should be actions. This part will list actions for both agency and client, at a high-level, which were completed in the previous week, and actions for both parties to be completed in the following week.

The reason for including actions is simply for web project momentum and accountability.

By this I mean that although a web project schedule may have been produced that has a zillion tasks on it, many clients will be busy with other work and a short list of ‘things they need to do this week’ can be a handy tool for them.

As well as a makeshift to do list, these action lists can also serve as conversations linked to the web project schedule, for example, if in one weekly report a client has an action to deliver content to you and fails to do so and you know this affects the schedule, you can point to specific un-completed actions as causes for slips – again, this transparency and communication helps you out too!

FORCES GOOD WEB PROJECT MANAGEMENT PRACTICE
As busy chainsaw juggling Web Project Managers, one of our constant challenges is sticking to processes when time is short. At times like this it’s all too easy to cut corners and the weekly report is understandably one of the first things deemed as not critical.

A photograph of a man in a shirt and trousers juggling three handheld food blenders lit by a stage spotlight in front of a red stage-like curtainSome Web Project Managers like to exaggerate
However discipline is something that separates average web project managers from great ones.

Not only will the weekly report prove its weight in gold when things don’t go to plan, it also forces the web project manager to keep an eye on every project they’re running and trust me, to effectively stay on top of the multitude of projects you’re likely to have on at any one time you really have to be aware of the most minute detail on a regular basis.

The weekly report forces you to catch up with everyone and analyse the numbers when without you may take the “I’ll review it next week” approach and then one week becomes two – and then the earth falls in on itself and suddenly you’ve lost control of the project.

…and if you don’t believe it’s possible to lose control of a web project a little bit by taking your eye off the ball just for a week or two, you’re sorely mistaken!

WEEKLY WEB PROJECT STATUS REPORT CONTENTS
From the previous section it should be somewhat clear as to what should be included in a weekly web project report, but below is an example list of contents.

Client, web project name, date range the report covers
Actions completed last week
Actions to be completed this week
Web project schedule update
Web project budget update
Complete budget and broken budget down by phase
Questions, comments
Remember, these reports can be delivered in any format you feel is appropriate – some like to use a slide deck or PDF template, but you may find a message template on Basecamp or e-mail template work just as well.

As long as the format remains consistent and clear you’re all good to go!

PRODUCING WEEKLY WEB PROJECT REPORTS
There are many reasons why keeping disciplined enough to produce weekly web project status reports can be a complete ball ache and so below are a few tips that may help you.

YOU DON’T HAVE TO CREATE THE REPORT YOURSELF
Many Web Project Managers have executives or support staff, use them. You setup the template, you create and send the first three or four, but after that there is no reason why a competent executive couldn’t be the ones to dig out the data for you leaving you to adjust schedules, polish up and send on.

ADAPT PER CLIENT
All clients are different and as with web project management approaches, they’ll all react differently to methods of communication and you have to adapt accordingly.

While the fundamentals of the weekly report shouldn’t be changed too much, the way it’s written and delivered should match what you feel the client will be most responsive too. For example, if your client isn’t a ‘details person’ avoid lengthy reports, or if they’re not technical at all, make sure to not include technical web jargon as much as possible.

A screenshot of a Tweet by Dan Storbaek that describes the KISS format for project reports. Keep It Short and Simple.Sexual PM tips from Dan
Adaptation also extends to how you deliver the report, some clients will be happy to just receive it in an e-mail with a short summary, whereas others respond better to the report and quick call to go through it.

Personally I’ll call the client for the first few and then just send through thereafter, unless there are specific elements I’d like to talk to them about.

The important thing is that the client doesn’t see the e-mail arrive in their Inbox, or meeting request reminder pop-up and groan, but instead feel like they’re receiving a professional service and the information included is important.

DON’T DROP BOMBSHELLS IN REPORTS
Although weekly web project reports are the place to capture vital things such as project and budget updates, make sure you don’t let the client find out these facts from the report alone. If any time I feel the total, or phase budget is at risk of overrun, or the schedule is slipping and needs revision, I’ll speak to the client when I realise and not surprise them in the report.

SUMMARY
Producing and sending weekly web project status reports to clients seems like an obvious one, and something many of us start out doing at the beginning of a web project, but as the workload builds up and other projects on your plate are starting or ending, it can often fall by the wayside. This might not seem to be a problem in the short term, but it will become one the minute something doesn’t go according to plan.

From the very beginning it’s important to remain disciplined and send your client a report every week. In this report you should highlight key information such as actions completed, actions to do, schedule and budget updates.

RECORD YOUR WEB PROJECT MANAGEMENT MEETINGS
- May 3, 2011 - by thesambarnes, in Digital Project Management, with 19 comments -

For once I’m just going to share something I’ve been doing for years that I could now not imagine not doing… dressing up as Princess Leia from Return of the Jedi and re-enacting the ‘lying in front of Jabba’ scene all chained up n stuff.

A picture of toy version of Jabba the Hutt and Princess Leia from a Return of the Jedi sceneAwwwwww, look at cuddly lil Jabba
Ok now that confession is out of the way, I’d also like to let you know how using a digital voice recorder in web project management meetings has proved invaluable time and time again for me when compared to old skool method of note taking with pen and paper.

THE PROBLEM WITH NOTE TAKING
Don’t get me wrong, when it comes to being a Web Project Manager I never go anywhere without my notepad and pen, despite it being a cheap notepad and having never actually owned a pen like a proper grown up.

However there are just some web project management meetings where I get back to the office, look at my notes and realise they no longer make sense as they did in the meeting, but look like a cross between that guy’s tattoos in Prison Break and the scribbles on the wall of a mental case who didn’t leave his room for twenty years before being separated from society.

The web project management meetings I’m talking about are the long ones where you’re required to understand your client’s entire business model, current technical and business workflows and rules, design brief and the oodles of new requirements they have – and all in the space of one or two hours.

Now perhaps I’m just useless at note taking, but the fact is I just can’t remember all that information word for word and got a little scared when I had that inevitable moment we all have from time to time where your eyes glaze over, you see people talking, you nod profusely, but you’re literally hearing nothing.

It was moments like this that resulted in me buying a digital voice recorder – ladies and gentleman, I present to you Excalibur!

A picture of a white digital voice recorder on a wooden surfaceBehold Excalibur – she’s beautiful… innit
THE DIGITAL VOICE RECORDER SOLUTION
Due to my note taking being not great, the primary reason I use a digital voice recorder in detailed web project management meetings is because I want to focus 100% on the meeting and I’m not senior enough to have a PA.

In all seriousness, when I’m talking to a client about their business, project and requirements I genuinely want to immerse myself into the process and really get down and dirty in the details, for two main reasons:

I know off the back of the meeting I will have to probably create a sitemap, functional specification and creative brief and I will need to get the details right
I want the meeting to flow smoothly and be an organic conversation. I find this type of meeting to be brilliantly productive and invariably ends up with both parties getting excited about the web project
Once the meeting is over, I press ‘Stop’ and head on back to the office. I know all that detailed goodness is captured and will be there for me when I need to sit down and write some documents or brief the team – in fact, the team can also listen to the meeting themselves – double efficiency bonus points!

I won’t drone on much more about the why, needless to say the number of times I’ve sat with headphones writing a big functional specification and literally enjoyed capturing a complex piece of functionality perfectly, first time – high bloody five!

ALTERNATIVE RECORDING SOLUTIONS
Of course nowadays digital voice recorders look a little archaic and alternative solutions are available for all you smartphone and tablet people.

A picture of two iOS app icons with a little Yoda cuddly toy face poking out from the bottom-right corner“Clever iOS note taking apps are”
These range from simple voice recorders to awesome apps that let you record a meeting, type notes, draw diagrams, and even highlight the notes and drawings you made in sync with the playback. A few decent ones for the iPad are:

Audionote
Noteability
However, I did try using these and personally found it a little more cumbersome than pen and paper and also made me come across slightly detached from the client, like typing away on a laptop does – but maybe this type of solution will work for you.

NAVIGATING THE EXCALIBUR UNVEILING
Although the theory and practice of recording web project meetings is solid, it’s still a little bit of a taboo when you mention the idea to a client, and to be honest I’m not surprised – it’s not exactly standard practice and there are confidentiality concerns.

But I find, as always with clients, honesty is the best policy and by simply explaining that you want to concentrate 100% on the meeting itself and not note taking, and that it will ensure you capture all the fine detail and enable more efficient briefing and web project documents, you’ll generally get agreement.

In fact clients tend to fall into three camps when they see Excalibur, the:

Happy and understanding type who say “Ooo good idea!”
Tentative but accommodating type who say something along the lines of “Ok, but I won’t see this posted on YouTube will I?” while laughing nervously
Very freaked out type who simply say they do not want to be recorded
The first two types of clients end up not thinking about the recorder 30 seconds into the meeting, and the third type, if you’re smart, you’ll identify before even being silly enough to get the recorder out.

A picture of an oil painting of ex-US President Richard NixonSometimes, recording is just a bad idea
But in case you’re not too smart (like me, trust me I learnt the hard way) here’s a few handy tips on when to suggest recording and when not too.

THE DOS AND DON’TS OF RECORDING
DO
Be completely honest about the fact you’d like to record the meeting, even if it’s a conference call
Make the point to mention you will be discreet with the recording
Name your recordings semantically so you don’t have to trawl through “untitled.mp3″ only to find out it wasn’t the meeting you needed after all
Use your instinct to determine if it would feel appropriate to get the recorder out
DON’T
Try to record pre-sales meetings and conflict resolution meetings
Record meetings where it isn’t necessary e.g. budget discussions
Ever use recordings to try and settle web project disputes
Send recordings to non-employees
Covertly record, ever – it’s just plain wrong and illegal I think
But come on, I’m probably just a bit rubbish when it comes to note taking, and because it’s just not always appropriate to record web project management meetings…

…what are your tips for note taking in web project management meetings?


## Designers

ou know how it usually goes… the client likes your agency and decides to go with you based on one or two great pitch meetings, a stunning proposal that includes the right timeline / budget and a couple of speculative mock-ups of what their new site could look like in your capable hands – brrrrap everyone rejoice!



You sign contracts and NDAs, and it’s time to actually get to work kicking off the project… the first question comes “When can I see some designs?”

To which many a Web Project Manager out there will reply “In a week” – I believe this is a big mistake.

I’ve experienced this approach, and taken my own enough times to back this belief up, let me explain…

THE SPECULATIVE WORK TREND
Before we get onto why I think providing mock-ups too early is a mistake we’ll deal with something some of you may object to right from the off – speculative web design work at the pitch stage.

There is a strong feeling amongst the web elite that providing visual mock-ups as part of the sales process is wrong for many reasons. Back in 2009 Ryan Taylor wrote a very concise article called Why Speculative Design is Wrong listing reasons like:

It costs everybody money
It’s about selling not delivering
It’s wasteful
It’s uninformed
It ignores the collaborative nature of design
I happen to agree with every single word of this post and there have been focussed attempts to champion this approach in the industry, by the likes of NO!!SPEC, in the hope it slowly but surely changes our industry’s attitudes about providing this ‘free’ and misguided work and ultimately eradicates it from the prospective client’s expected sales process.

However, back then, as much as now, I couldn’t help feeling that this would be a hard nut to crack for the very fact that it relies on three things:

Enough web agencies and freelancers get on-board and refuse to do speculative work
Those same agencies and people have a solid enough portfolio that they can rely on as sales aid
They’re skilled enough in sales and client management to sell the ‘no spec’ position and still win the work
I would love this shift to take place and never have to do any speculative design work again, but my gut feeling is this just will never happen on a permanent basis.

A poster of a single from the Irish boy band JedwardUnfortunately some things will never go away
The fact of the matter is I believe it really is only established web agencies and freelancers who can pull this off and the majority of lesser known people out there will always submit to the request for mock-ups and see it, as do most clients, as an integral part of the web sales process.

But while I don’t believe this tradition will change anytime soon, I do believe many agencies then make their first crucial mistake – and it isn’t producing speculative designs, but beginning the web project based on the speculative designs that helped them win the work in the first place.

THE FIRST MISTAKE
I understand it because I learnt the hard way, but some people don’t seem to learn. Three of the reasons Ryan Taylor states as a reason to not do speculative work are actually the exact same reasons why using a pitch design is precisely the wrong thing to base the final design solution off – in fact the “It’s wasteful” reason IS often the result of following this path.

What was the point of producing a piece of design only to discard it? Because ultimately you (the client) are paying for the design it is absurd that you would then choose not to use it.
Ryan Taylor, Why Speculative Design is Wrong

However this statement was made on the assumption that all those who produce speculative designs throw them away upon commencement of the web project, well unfortunately they don’t.

Many out there seem to think it’s best to keep the designs in place for one main reason – if the client loved the designs; it must be what they want. Well maybe yes, but it’s important to identify what the client liked about it before proceeding to base the rest of the web project on it.

All too often it will transpire that the functionality implied by those very early designs, based on probably only 3-4 hours of communication with the client, will actually be built without nearly enough thought given to if they really need it.

What you’ll usually find is the client actually loved the style and colours used in the speculative designs – the final design and functionality should not be set in concrete at this stage.

THE SECOND MISTAKE
The second mistake often made is to start a won web project by briefing your designer to create a homepage and perhaps some sub-page designs for client approval – no no no!

An old photograph of Sam Barnes as a child painting a bad picture on a child's standing upright easelYes, this is me, and yes I’m designing far to early
Why not? Well because at this early stage of the project you still have an awful lot of research to do in order to clarify exactly what the best solution is, from a design and functional perspective, so how can you really expect to produce designs that satisfy the user requirements and ensure that the business goals are aligned with the agreed functionality when they haven’t all been completely agreed yet? Quite simply, you can’t.

Good design comes from being well informed. The designer needs to understand business objectives, success criteria, brand personality, competition and numerous other factors in order to provide the right solution.
Ryan Taylor, Why Speculative Design is Wrong

What invariably happens next when adopting this approach is what I believe to be one of the biggest causes of budget overrun in web projects – the designs will be ‘signed-off’, the functionality will then be agreed and defined, and then come the budget and time sapping design revisions that bring those early homepage and sub-pages in-line with what will actually be built.

Don’t rush straight into solution design and build before you’ve done the groundwork. Take time to create a good plan, gather customer requirements, and create solid functional and technical specifications.

Why not just skip these unnecessary revisions altogether with some confident web project and client management skills!

THE ALTERNATIVE APPROACH BOMBSHELL
My approach is to win the web project and then definitely not agree to produce a single design for quite a while.

Image of a stern looking dog on the end of a lead refusing to move despite being pulled by its ownerWeb PMs often have to be stubborn for a project’s sake
Now I know what you’re thinking “Haha you naive fool Mr. Barnes, none of my clients would accept your ridiculous approach, they will insist on designs early and throw a complete hissy fit if I don’t do this for them!”

Well yes, in my experience most clients will not expect this approach easily but that’s when the confidence in the approach must show itself in the form of articulate explanation as to why you follow this approach.

THE ALTERNATIVE APPROACH
It’s at this point, usually in a kick-off meeting, I will explain to the client how the web project will be managed, what phases are involved, in what order they’ll occur and why, and it goes something like this:

I will take the budget and deadline and cast them in concrete (for now)
We’ll then talk, and talk for quite a bit and as we’re no longer in sales mode our conversation will almost certainly be more valuable. In these talks I will discuss your business goals and then cross match them against the functionality laid out in the proposal, crossing some off (with your complete approval and buy in) that actually don’t align with any of your goals and keeping those that do
We’ll then explore those that do in more depth and also discuss other functionality that may not have been in the proposal that would help you achieve your goals, to the point where I can visualise what your requirements are from a design and functional perspective, and have a pretty good idea of how the functionality will work, both in front of and behind the scenes
I’ll then vanish into my web project management Batcave and create an initial project breakdown that lists all the things we’ll need to complete and my estimated hours and hope and pray the total matches the agreed budget
If the numbers match, I’ll walk you through this list and explain that this is the first step to confirming what exactly we’re going to build and deliver and eventually you’ll approve this initial list
Then we produce a sitemap and functional specification for sign-off
Image of a very smarmy looking manager smiling while sitting at a desk with his chin resting on his handsI truly love your project approach Mr. Web Project Manager m’kay
At this point the client may protest and insist on designs much earlier as they “need to know what it will look like” or the “board of Directors want designs” – this is when you start the explanation for wanting to take this ‘crazy’ approach.

CONVINCING CLIENTS ON THE APPROACH
Now this is a debate you may win or lose. Losing means the client listens to your point of view and then says they don’t care, they must have designs first – but winning means you have not only almost certainly and immediately stopped precious web project hours being spent on design revisions, but you’ve also gained the client’s trust and respect – both the most valuable digital account and web project management commodities.

The actual explanation itself is nothing short of a crash course for the client in web design and functional separation. During the crash course you need to communicate five key points:

Achieving the business goals are the primary aim of the web project
The pages that need to be included to meet these goals can be decided independently of what they look like
The functionality (what the website or application must be able to do) is completely irrelevant to any design that will essentially be overlaid on top of the moving parts
By the mere fact the client has hired you means they’ve seen, and liked, the agency’s creative and UX capabilities and need to trust that the same quality level will be applied at the right time
When designs are eventually produced and presented they will be perfectly aligned with the required functionality, sitemap and business goals and thus reduce web project hours required and minimise budget overrun and thus more money needed
I won’t lie to you, most of the time this conversation is not easy and the client will challenge you at certain points, but the real secret lies in your ability to convey absolute conviction in your approach and if possible back it up with examples of previous web projects where the process was, and was not followed.

Retro style poster showing a man hypnotising a lion illustrated by a laser beam from his eyesWeb Project Managers must be able to control clients
For example you could show the client some previous speculative design work, followed by the first set of post-sale designs produced too early, then all subsequent revisions right up until the final version – and then show the amount of hours spent, and duration in work days / weeks, to reach the solution.

This can be followed up quickly by an example where the unorthodox approach was taken and, having used it many times before, I can assure you both the total hours and duration will be comparatively less.

When you start talking in a client’s language about best use of their money and quicker time to market they’ll invariably take a keen interest.

Of course with any web project management approach come challenges and so here are a few tips to help you with this one.

DON’T BE AFRAID TO RIP UP THE PROPOSAL
One thing I’ve learnt over the years is that the sale is the sale, and the project is the project – and both are very different beasts.

An image of a toy Star Wars Stormtrooper looking at a basic cardboard version of a StormtrooperA successful sale can spell for project disaster if badly sold
By this I mean in my early days as a Web Project Manager I used to take a sold web project proposal, with included speculative designs, and pretty much attempt to use those as a statement of work.

As the web project progressed it transpired that some requirements had been misunderstood, were no longer in the same priority and other requirements would emerge – and by the end of the web project, the final solution was often quite far from the outlined solution set out all those months ago – bad times.

Over time I began to view all of the sales documentation as a guide more than a blueprint.

Nowadays, upon receiving all of the sales ‘stuff’ I’ll open talks with the client and define their business goals, target audience, marketing plan and required functionality again. As described earlier in this post, I’ll then create a web project task list with time estimations and see if they match the numbers in the proposal – often they don’t and this is the point at which I’ll start talking to the client about what it would be best to deliver to them for their budget they have.

This may all sound a little odd, and perhaps if the people selling your web projects are amazingly accurate in requirement gathering then you’ll rarely have to go through this step, but in my experience sales documents are pretty high-level and numbers are ‘ball-park’ estimates.

A photograph of the 2007 Fiscal budget for the USA showing the front cover, and the massive amount of pages it containsProject budgets in proposals are rarely this detailed
At the end of the day, when I’m given a web project to manage I consider that it has an initial scope, rough budget and ideal timeline, but that none are final and all are negotiable – and ultimately if I can deliver a solution that the client is happy with, produces commercial return, and my agency can be proud of, then I’ve done my job well and my boss will be happy no matter what he originally sold.

Don’t forget, a happy client is not always one that you delivered a web project for as per the budget and timeline set out in the proposal, but one that is happy with how much they spent on the project and when it was delivered – these numbers and dates are in your control as a Web Project Manager, as is the relationship you form with the client.

I’ve delivered many a web project where it was delivered for twice the cost and weeks or even months later than the original proposal stated, but the client was a very happy person as the process was managed and communicated clearly and the eventual solution was the right one – food for thought.

Ultimately you’re looking for the following client reaction at the end of the web project… is this too much to ask for? I don’t think so.



COLLABORATION IS KEY
Moving ahead on a web project without any designs is not easy for some people, but it can also come across as a very waterfall-based approach where the Web Project Manager works in a silo with the client until such times as he or she are ready to hand over to the web designers and developers – but this is most definitely not the correct path.

At all times a Web Project Manager should be working very closely with everyone in their team, in fact failure to do this will always have a negative impact on the web project – no matter what your approach is.

With regards to my own approach, although I will not produce designs for a client until a sitemap and functional specification have been approved, this doesn’t mean I haven’t been talking to the web designers, UX and development teams while producing both – far from it.

A spoof poster with the large title of Collaborate that shows two women at an office desk - one is looking forward while the other is looking at her colleague, with the tagline - Sometimes your best option is to say it's all her faultWeb project collaboration also has unseen benefits
For example, when writing a functional specification you have to, to some extent, be able to visualise and define certain parts of the website or application that will influence or perhaps even dictate an eventual design or UX factor – but that’s fine – talk though these aspects with the teams, and talk through functionality with developers.

Not only is this collaborative approach getting the key people involved early, which always help to gain buy in and motivate teams, but in most cases a Web Project Manager is not the best person to define any of these things – this is not their expertise.

Part of a Web Project Manager’s expertise however is to get the right people involved at the right time, to utilise the experts in their field and to gently ensure the solutions provided by the experts are within the web project boundaries such as budget, scope and timeline.

THIS WORKS FOR ME, WHAT WORKS FOR YOU?
So this approach works for me, and works well, but as always in web project management different people have different approaches – so tell me

## Developers

his is a topic I’ve wanted to approach for a few years now and is really more of an open question to the digital community… why do developers live by different rules than others at work?

Note: The term ‘developer’ in this article really means anyone working in a digital environment on the production side, you know, people like this.



The ‘rules’ I’m referring to are specifically surrounding the use of Twitter, blog reading, YouTube, Facebook, flexitime and all of the other things that now seem to be a widely expected, and to some extent, accepted part of everyday life in many digital agencies out there i.e. things that many view as a sign of people not doing the job they’re being paid to.

THE CONTEXT SWITCHING ARGUMENT
As a Web Project Manager I’ve heard the two-pronged ‘context switching’ argument a billion times:

More efficient working:
If there wasn’t so much context switching due to meetings and people coming over to me I would work more efficiently.
Reason for poor quality or late delivery:
It’s taken longer due to all of the context switching I experienced.
As someone who, albeit unbelievable to some these days, genuinely used to code for a living, I can completely testify that both of these positions are 100% valid. When you’re coding, designing, or even writing a functional specification or creating a big project schedule – being in ‘the zone’ with no distractions is a must, and distractions are such a pain in the arse for momentum.

Is this the solution? Neat idea, or not practical as not everyone can always help with all queries equally?



However, the point to which I elude to above is that it’s not just coders who work better when context switching is kept to a minimum, but it does seem that these are who you hear about from the most – why is that?

And why is it that having a Twitter client permanently on-screen where Tweets are popping up every second, distracting you unexpectedly from your work is considered to be not context switching?

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
The only reason I’m genuinely curious to hear answers from people on this is because I personally find having things such constantly open on my screen to be a terrible distraction that seriously impedes my productivity and focus.

In fact I find it worse because it tends to be a more frequent occurrence than someone coming over to me or a short-notice meeting being arranged. If I can see a meeting is arranged for two hours time, I’ll tend to work around this necessity rather than complain about it like it’s some big surprise I wasn’t expecting, as do pretty much all other Web Project Managers I’ve worked with – incidentally these people rarely seem to have Twitter open permanently, even the ones who used to design or code.

Is it that I’m just useless as being able to balance these things with my work focus, or is it that it distracts developers just as much as me but they wouldn’t like to admit it in case this culture is stopped dead in its tracks?

DEVELOPER’S JUSTIFICATION
I’ve discussed this subject for quite a few years with developers in various workplaces and forums, and the common reasons given for this culture being a beneficial one tend to boil down to:

It enables me to keep up to date with the latest goings on in the industry.
Having a five minute break to browse Twitter or YouTube helps me relax.
I can’t be expected to work every minute of every day.
My answers to these have remained fixed over the years:

Is there really any industry news that you or the company will benefit from by you knowing about it now as opposed to in a few hours when it’s your lunch, or after work that day?
Fair enough, but often it seems more like more than five minutes, just saying…
Why not, I do (*kind of)
*Caveat: I fully admit I think I talk more than I should at work, usually distracting my very hard working Web Project Manager colleague, and I also take 2-3 cigarette breaks a day, but you know what, many developers do these things also, on top of the ‘Twitter-thang’.

So is it that it’s simply a case that this culture is beneficial to companies, or is it one that isn’t from a commercial perspective, but is just what we’ve all become conditioned to over the years?

A BENEFICIAL CULTURE OR MERELY TOLERATED?
As an employer or Web Project Manager this is ultimately the big question. I don’t know the answer to this, but as far as I see the point and counterpoints are clear.

POINT
Digital folk are a unique bunch of people who generally have a passion for the industry that exceeds the boundaries and hours of their day job.

A photo of Moss from The IT Crowd in a scene where he’s dressed as a barman saying Yes Miss?Most people just don’t understand us and our ways
More to the point, an employer or Web Project Manager, would rather have people with this passion on their team than those who do not as they’ll tend to go above and beyond, stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies and be more dedicated to the solutions they provide, as opposed to those who see their job as just a job and clock off on time every night.

By promoting a culture where they’re allowed to have Twitter open all day long and read blog posts during work hours means you attract and retain the passionate people in the industry rather than the clock watchers.

Developers can choose when to context switch to Twitter, YouTube or blog posts, as opposed to ad hoc disruptions from Web Project Managers, this timing makes all the difference.

Not permitting this culture would result in the passionate people leaving and a ‘corporate’ environment ensuing, and who wants to work in a corporate environment where every minute of every day is tracked.

COUNTERPOINT
If developers spent less time looking at Twitter, YouTube and blog posts throughout the day more work would get done. If more work gets done, the company is more productive and generally more profitable, which means salaries, perks and benefits go up, not to mention the entire team is trusted more and slowly but surely allowed to run things how they want rather than being micro-managed.

By all means watch videos and Tweet during lunch, and maybe a few times during the day, but abusing this culture really impacts on the perception of how hard you’re working, or highlights the fact that perhaps you aren’t. This in turn de-motivates those who feel they’re working harder than you and to bosses who don’t understand the culture, it re-enforces their perception of you being rebellious teenagers who makez web pagez.

A photo of the manager in the TV show The IT Crowd shouting Standard Nerdz!Bosses sometimes subtly stereotype people
The argument that developers deploy, saying that choosing when to context switch makes all the difference seems to fall flat on its face when you cannot predict what or when a Tweet will appear and they’ll inevitably click through to read no matter what they’re doing at the time.

Each time a mistake is made, delivery is late or budgets overrun, if you cite context switching as being a primary reason, to some this will seem tantamount to insulting given that you visibly spent what seems like ‘too long’ on Twitter during either the early phases of the project of launch week.

MY EXPERIENCE, AGAIN
Having worked with and for companies that both promote and discourage this culture, I’ve not seen any major differences between attracting quality staff and/or retaining them.

The only difference I’ve seen is in the attitudes of those at companies who discourage it, and it seems a little more commercially minded and contains a lot less ‘divas’.

On the flipside, companies who encourage or permit it tend to seem much ‘cooler’ and more akin to the Google and Facebook-esque era that we now live in.

A WEB PROJECT MANAGER’S PERSPECTIVE
It will be pretty obvious what side of the argument I personally come down on, but the truth is that’s down to utter selfishness.

By that I mean, I too love what I do, I’m a Web Project Manager and my job boils down to delivering web projects on time, on budget and to a good quality standard. There are things that happen during every single web project that seem to be demanded by the Gods to prevent me, and everyone else in the web project management world, from achieving that.

I expect it to happen, I plan for it, I fight for contingency budget to cater for it – I do lots of things, and sometimes even consider praying to the Gods, but obviously don’t – that discussion is for another time – but I don’t blame you in any way, that’s just how web projects go.

A screenshot of Twitter use GrumpyPM saying if you spend less time moaning and more time doing we can wrap this project up.Behold the Grumpy PM and his infinite wisdom
But while I’m doing all of this to try and make everything run smoothly, as things start to go wrong and the whiners start to whine, I often grumble to myself and others at how the whiners can complain about lack of time or context switching when they’ve found the time to read every Tweet that day, click through to a few links, read the posts and watch several funny videos – it infuriates me – but – I’m ready to understand…

THE BIG FIVE QUESTIONS
If you’ve made it this far or just skipped to the end like Simon Pegg in Spaced, I’m ready to listen, and I want you to help me understand by answering these questions:

Why do you feel context switching when designing or coding is harder than any other context switching for others doing work that requires focussed concentration that perhaps isn’t designing or coding?
Why do you find it acceptable and possible to easily context switch between work and Twitter, blog posts etc. when you say you can’t possibly context switch for pre-planned meetings and general day-to-day disruptions that happen during the average working day?
Why do you quickly click off Twitter, Amazon, Facebook etc. back to work when you see a manager approaching if you don’t think it’s naughty?
Have you ever worked anywhere where this culture was discouraged? What were the big differences?
Do you believe there is real commercial value in this culture? If so can you articulate what it is?
C’mon, sell it to me; sell it to our bosses, please. There must be some Web Project Managers our there who also stay on Twitter all day and read blog posts etc. Why do you find it beneficial? Or, in what way do you see it as a beneficial thing for your project team to be doing?













Continuous Integration makes dev life easier. Happier, better developers and testers. More efficient cycle. Keeps people happy.

It's not about the work that you do, but the work you enable others to do.

Smaller teams can afford to keep goals small and finish them often. Then you can test faster and learn quicker. By working quickly you can make decisions quickly, things flow better, and other teams will be envious. Cut your chunks of work into smaller chunks. Keep going to the minimum. If you can see measured improvement then do the rest of the chunks. If not, you've only lost a day or two maximum. Communicating frequently about what you're releasing makes you feel truly agile. Releasing often not only makes the team look good internally, but improves the end result for users too.

### THINK HOW, NOT WHAT
Your product isn’t just a bunch of features - so stop focusing on them.

What matters is not what functionality your product has, but how it works. A sign-up process is not just a sign-up process, a checkout process is not just a checkout process, a button is not just a button, a rating system is not just a rating system. Think about how you can stand out by introducing something that everyone else might have but in a unique way - what you are selling at it’s core. Here are a few questions to answer:

What is needed for your product to function well?
How much can you take away from it without sacrificing the core product
Why will people be excited about it
Glasses have one primary purpose, to help you see. Everything on top of that - such as colors, shapes, sizes and logos - is a feature. Understand when you are working on your core product and when you are working on adding features. The benefits of thinking like this, is that it will help you establish a very clear and precise picture of what makes your product your product. This will help you understand the minimal work necessary to get a valuable product out the door, and why you are adding features when you are.

You will be surprised how much the “how” can help improving your product - and getting an MVP out the door.

### SHIPPED IS BETTER THAN PERFECT
The goal of sketching, wireframing and prototyping is delivering great product concepts, not great deliverables.

Nobody cares if your deliverables are great if they’re not finished. And few will care how perfect they are even if they are finished. The only people who may marvel at the deliverables are the UX designers, but they’re hopefully too busy to care about internal documentation. On the other hand, everyone wants or absolutely needs you to communicate the right level of details about what they need to do to make a great and feasible solution so they can ship better products, faster.

If you’ve sketched something on scrap paper that you’re confident is a solid solution that everyone can act on immediately, there’s no value in re-creating it in a wireframe or anywhere else. Just take a picture of it and share it where appropriate. In some cases, you may have to quickly replicate it for organizational purposes, but don’t make deliverables for the sake of it - you have better things to do.

When we launched Perch we were, in most cases gently, mocked for writing it in that language everyone loves to hate – PHP. We were quizzed as to why we were not using a trendy NoSQL database. Our technology decisions however, were entirely sensible. They were based on what we knew to be true – that our target customers would not have Python, Ruby on Rails or the latest database available on their cheap hosting. We couldn’t even rely on them to have up to date PHP.

When it comes to launching your own product, it is very tempting to use it as the chance to do all of those things you never get to do in your day job, or on client projects. At last YOU are the client, as a developer there is little more fun than getting to grips with a new technology, building things with the shiniest tools. However, will that serve your customers well? Will they even care, or worse will your latest and greatest languages, tools and techniques actually prevent them from using your product?

PHP isn’t fashionable, a NoSQL database could actually be a great fit for Perch, however if it isn’t available on our target customer’s hosting then there is no point considering it.

The people who will allow you to build a great business around your product are far more invested in your success, because they use your product every day. In our case customers have built their business around selling sites built using Perch. Often they are not developers, but designers and learning a new CMS takes a considerable investment of time. They put a great deal of faith in us, that we won’t turn Perch into something that they can’t use. They trust that we won’t sell out, or otherwise abandon them and we really value that trust.

Understand what people needWe must begin digital projects by exploring and pinpointing the needs of the people who will use the service, and the ways in which the service will fit into their lives. Whether the users are members of the public or government employees, policy makers must include real people in their design process from the very beginning. The needs of people — not constraints of government structures or silos — should drive technical and design decisions. We need to continually test the products we build with real people to keep us honest about what is important.checklist
* Early in the project, spend time with current and prospective users of the service
* Use a range of qualitative and quantitative user research methods to determine people’s goals, needs, and behaviors; be thoughtful about the time spent
* Test prototypes of possible solutions with real people, in the field if possible
* Document the findings about user goals, needs, behaviors, and preferences
* Share findings with the team and agency leadership
* Create a prioritized list of user stories, which are short descriptions of the goals the user is trying to accomplish
* As the digital service is being built, regularly test it with potential users to ensure it will meet peoples’ needs
key questions
    * What user needs will this service address?
    * Why does the user want or need this service?
    * Who are your key users?
    * Which people will have the most difficulty with your service?
    * What research methods were used?
    * What were the key findings from users’ current experience?
    * How were the findings documented? Where can future team members access the documentation?
    * How often are you testing with real people?


Address the whole experience, from start to finishWe must build digital services with an understanding of the range of ways a person might interact with our service, including the actions they take online, through a mobile application, on the phone, or in person. Every encounter should move the user closer towards the desired outcome, whether that encounter is online or offline.checklist
Understand the different points at which people will interact with the service – both online and in person
Identify pain points in the current way users interact with the service, and prioritize these according to user needs
Design the digital parts of the service so that they are integrated with the offline touch points people use to interact with the service
Develop metrics that will measure how well the service is meeting user needs, at each step of the service
key questions
What are the different ways (both online and offline) that people currently accomplish the task the digital service is designed to help with?
Where are user pain points in the current way people accomplish the task?
Where does this specific project fit into the larger way people currently obtain the service being offered?
What metrics will best indicate how well the service is working for its users?

Make it simple and intuitiveUsing a government service shouldn’t be stressful, confusing, or daunting — it’s our job to build services that are simple and intuitive enough that users succeed the first time, unaided.checklist
Create or use an existing, simple, and flexible design style guide for the service
Use the design style guide across related digital services
Provide users with clear information about where they are in the process as they use the service
Follow accessibility best practices to ensure all people can use the service
Provide users with a way to exit and return later to complete the process
Use language that is familiar to the user and is easy to understand
Use language and design consistently throughout the service, including in the online and offline (non-digital) touch points people use to interact with the service
key questions
What primary tasks are the user trying to accomplish?
What is the reading level of the language the service uses?
What languages is your service offered in?
If a user needs help while using the service how do they go about getting it?
How does the service’s design visually relate to other government services?
PLAY 4

Build the service using agile and iterative practicesWe should use an incremental, fast-paced style of software development to reduce the risk of failure by getting working software into users’ hands quickly, and by providing frequent opportunities for the delivery team members to adjust requirements and development plans based on watching people use prototypes and real software. A critical capability is being able to automatically test and deploy the service so that new features can be added often and easily put into production. Following agile methodologies is a proven best practice for building digital services, and will increase our ability to build services that effectively meet user needs.checklist
Ship a functioning “minimum viable product” (MVP) that solves a core user need addressed by the service as soon as possible, and not longer than three months from the beginning of any new digital project, using a “beta” or “test” period if needed
Run usability tests frequently to see how well the service works for users, and identify improvements that should be made
Ensure the individuals building the service are in close communication using techniques such as war rooms, daily standups, and team chat tools
Keep delivery teams small and focused; limit organizational layers that separate these teams from the business owners
Release features and improvements multiple times each month
Create a prioritized list of features and bugs, also known as the “feature backlog” and “bug backlog”
Use an “issue tracker” to catalog features and bugs
Use a source code version control system
Ensure entire team has access to the issue tracker and version control system
Use code reviews to ensure quality
key questions
How long did it take to ship the MVP? If it has not shipped yet, when will it?
How long does it take for a production deployment?
How long in days are the iterations/sprints?
Which source code version control system is being used?
What tool is being used to track bugs and issue tickets?
What tool is being used to manage the feature backlog?

Choose a modern technology stackThe technology decisions we make need to enable development teams to work efficiently and enable services to scale easily and cost-effectively. Our choices for hosting infrastructure, databases, software frameworks, programming languages and the rest of the technology stack should seek to avoid vendor lock-in and match what successful modern consumer and enterprise software companies would choose today. In particular, digital services teams should consider using open source, cloud based, and commodity solutions across the technology stack, as these solutions have seen widespread adoption and support by the most successful private-sector consumer and enterprise software technology companies.checklist
Choose software frameworks that are commonly used by private-sector companies creating similar services
To the extent practical, ensure that software can be deployed on a variety of commodity hardware types
Ensure that each project has easy to understand instructions for setting up a local development environment, and that team members can be quickly added or removed from projects
Consider open source software solutions at all layers of the stack

Deploy in a flexible hosting environmentOur services should be deployed on flexible infrastructure, where resources can be provisioned in real time to meet spikes in user demand. Our digital services are crippled when we host them in data centers which market themselves as “cloud hosting” but require us to manage and maintain hardware directly. This outdated practice wastes time, weakens our disaster recovery plans, and results in significantly higher costs.checklist

Automate testing and deploymentsToday, developers write automated scripts that can verify thousands of scenarios in minutes and then deploy updated code into production environments multiple times per day. They use automated performance tests which simulate surges in traffic to identify performance bottlenecks. While manual tests and quality assurance is still necessary, automated tests provide consistent and reliable protection against unintentional regressions, and make it possible for developers to confidently release frequent updates to the service.checklist

Manage security and privacy through reusable processesIt is critical that our digital services protect sensitive information and keep systems secure. This is typically a process of continuous review and improvement which should be built into the development and maintenance of the service. At the start of designing a new service or feature, the team lead should engage the appropriate privacy, security, and legal officer(s) to discuss the type of information collected, how it should be secured, and how it may be used and shared. The sustained engagement of a privacy specialist helps ensure that personal data is properly managed. In addition, a key process to building a secure service is comprehensively testing and certifying the components in each layer of the technology stack for security vulnerabilities, and then to re-use these same pre-certified components for multiple services.The following checklist provides a starting point, but teams should work closely with their privacy specialist and security engineer to meet the needs of the specific service.checklist
Contact the appropriate privacy or legal officer of the department or agency to determine whether a System of Records Notice (SORN), Privacy Impact Assessment, or other review should be conducted
Determine, in consultation with a records officer, what data is collected and why, how it is used or shared, how it is stored and secured, and how long it is kept
Determine, in consultation with a privacy specialist, whether and how users are notified about how personal information is collected and used, including whether a privacy policy is needed and where it should appear, and how users will be notified in the event of a security breach
Consider whether the user should be able to access, delete, or remove their information from the service
“Pre-certify” the hosting infrastructure used for the project using FedRAMP
Use deployment scripts to ensure configuration of production environment remains consistent and controllable
key questions
Does the service collect personal information from the user (whether government or public)? How is the user notified of this collection?
Does it collect more information than is needed to perform the requested task? Are there uses of the data that would not be expected by the average user?
How does a user contact a responsible person to seek access, correction, deletion, or removal of his or her personal information?
Will information stored in the system be shared with others?
How and how often is the service tested for security vulnerabilities?
How can someone from the public report a security issue?

Use data to drive decisionsAt all stages of a digital project, we should measure how well our service is working for our users. This includes measuring how well a system performs and how people are interacting with the system in real time. Our teams and agency leadership should carefully watch these metrics to proactively spot issues and identify which improvements should be prioritized. In addition to monitoring tools, a feedback mechanism should be in place for people to report issues directly.checklist

What is a product manager? What do product managers do all day? Most importantly, why do companies need to hire them? Good questions.
The first confusion we have to clear up is what we mean by “product.” In the context of software development, a product is the website, application or online service that users interact with. Depending on the size of the company and its products, a product manager could be responsible for an entire system (such as a mobile app) or part of a system (such as the checkout flow on an e-commerce website across all devices).
This is confusing because, in most contexts, a product is a thing you sell to people. Particularly in e-commerce, product managers often get confused with category managers, which are the team that sources and merchandises the products sold on an e-commerce website. So, yes, “product” probably isn’t the best word for it. But it’s what we’ve got, and it’s the word we’ll refer to in exploring this role.
To define the role of a product manager, let’s start by looking at Marc Andreessen’s view of the only thing that matters in a startup:
The quality of a startup’s product can be defined as how impressive the product is to one customer or user who actually uses it: How easy is the product to use? How feature rich is it? How fast is it? How extensible is it? How polished is it? How many (or rather, how few) bugs does it have?
The size of a startup’s market is the the number, and growth rate, of those customers or users for that product.…
The only thing that matters is getting to product-market fit. Product-market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.
Even though Andreessen wrote this for startups, the importance of that last sentence about product-market fit holds truth for every organization — whether the organization is getting a new product to market or redesigning an existing experience or anything in between. It is a universal road map to success, and it is the core of what product managers are responsible for.
With that as the backdrop, my definition of the role of a product manager would be to achieve business success by meeting user needs through the continual planning and execution of digital product solutions.
This definition summarizes all of the things that a product manager needs to obsess over: the target market, the intricacies of the product, what the business needs in order to succeed, and how to measure that success. It also encapsulates the three things that a product manager should never lose sight of:
The ultimate measure of success is the health of the business and, therefore, the value that the product provides to users.
Everything starts with a solid understanding of the target market and its needs, so that the focus remains on the quality of the product experience.
A continual cycle of planning and execution is required to meet these market needs in a sustainable way.
So, how does this translate to what a product manager does every day? That question is way too big to answer here, but as an introduction, Marty Cagan has a great list of common tasks that product managers are responsible for in his ebook Behind Every Great Product (PDF). The tasks include:
identifying and assessing the validity and feasibility of product opportunities,
making sure the right product is delivered at the right time,
developing a product strategy and road map for development,
leading the team in executing the product’s road map,
evangelizing the product internally to the executive team and colleagues,
representing customers through the product development process.
But before a product manager is able to do these things, a couple of awkward questions have to be asked. First, do companies really need product managers? And, if we can agree on that, what are the characteristics of a good one? Also, where does this role fit in an organization’s structure? Let’s explore these questions.
Why Companies Need Product Managers
The role of product manager can be a hard sell for some companies. Common objections to it include:
“We have various people in the organization whose roles fulfill each of these functions.”
“I don’t see how the role would make us more money.”
“Product managers would just slow us down.”
“I don’t want to relinquish control of the product to someone else.” (OK, this one is not usually said out loud.)
These appear to be valid concerns, but only if the role is not well understood — or if the organization has bad product managers who perpetuate these perceptions.
The truth is that, to be effective, the role of a manager for a particular product or area must not be filled by multiple people. It is essential for the product manager to see the whole picture — the strategic vision as well as the details of implementation — in order to make good decisions about the product. If knowledge of different parts of the process resides in the heads of different people, then no one will have that holistic view, and all value will be drained of the role.
Let’s look at two major benefits that product managers bring.
PRODUCT MANAGERS ENSURE A MARKET-DRIVEN APPROACH
The key argument in favor of product managers is that they help companies to be driven by the needs and goals of the target market, not the forces of technology or fads. As Barbara Nelson puts it in “Who Needs Product Management?”:
It is vastly easier to identify market problems and solve them with technology than it is to find buyers for your existing technology.
If done right, a market-driven focus results in long-term, sustainable, profitable business, because the company will remain focused on solving market problems, as opposed to looking for things to do with the latest technologies. A market-driven focus is important because companies that have one are proven to be more profitable than those driven by other factors (31% more profitable, according to George S. Day and Prakash Nedungadi).
This doesn’t mean focusing on incremental change to the exclusion of product innovation. Identifying market problems is about not only finding existing issues to improve (for example, “60% of users drop off on this page, so let’s fix that”), but also about creating new products to satisfy unmet needs (“Cell phones suck — let’s make a better one”).
PRODUCT MANAGERS IMPROVE TIME-TO-EVERYTHING
The second major benefit of product managers is that they reduce the time an organization takes to reach its goals. A well-defined and appropriate product development process run by effective managers will improve both the time-to-market as well as the time-to-revenue.
The reason for the faster turnaround time is that a product manager is responsible for figuring out what’s worth building and what’s not. This means less time spent on the spaghetti approach to product development (throwing things against the wall to see what sticks) and more time spent on building products that have been validated in the market. This approach also sharpens the organization’s focus, enabling the organization to dedicate more people to products that are likely to succeed, instead of spreading people too thin on projects that no one is sure will have a product-market fit.



7 Principles of Rich Web Applications

November 4, 2014 – 127504 views
This is a writeup based on a presentation I gave at BrazilJS in August 2014. It builds on some of the ideas I’ve been blogging about recently related mostly to UX and performance.

I want to introduce 7 actionable principles for websites that want to make use of JavaScript to control their UI. They are the result of my experience as a web developer, but also as a long-time user of the WWW.

JavaScript has undeniably become an indispensable tool for frontend developers. Its usage is now expanding into other areas like servers and microcontrollers. It’s the language of choice for introducing computer science concepts by prestigious universities.

Yet a lot of questions on its precise role and usage on the web remain a mystery, even to many framework and library authors.

Should JavaScript be used to replace browser functions like history, navigation and page rendering?
Is the backend dying? Should I render HTML at all?
Are Single Page Applications (SPAs) the future?
Is JS supposed to augment pages for websites, but render pages in web apps?
Should techniques like PJAX or TurboLinks be used?
What’s the precise distinction between a website and a web application? Should there be one at all?
What follows is my attempt to answer these. My approach is to examine the usage of JavaScript exclusively from the lens of user experience (UX). In particular, I put a strong focus on the idea of minimizing the time it takes the user to get the data they are interested in. Starting with networking fundamentals all the way to predicting the future.

Server rendered pages are not optional
Act immediately on user input
React to data changes
Control the data exchange with the server
Don’t break history, enhance it
Push code updates
Predict behavior
 1. Server rendered pages are not optional

tl;DR: Server rendering is not about SEO, it’s about performance. Consider the additional roundtrips to get scripts, styles, and subsequent API requests. In the future, considering HTTP 2.0 PUSH of resources.
The first thing I’m compelled to point out is a fairly common false dichotomy. That of “server-rendered apps vs single-page apps”. If we want to optimize for the best possible user experience and performance, giving up one or the other is never a good idea.

The reasons are fairly straightforward. The medium by which pages are transmitted, the internet, has a theoretical speed limit. This has been memorably illustrated by the famous essay/rant “It’s the latency, stupid” by Stuart Cheshire:

The distance from Stanford to Boston is 4320km.
The speed of light in vacuum is 300 x 10^6 m/s.
The speed of light in fibre is roughly 66% of the speed of light in vacuum.
The speed of light in fibre is 300 x 10^6 m/s * 0.66 = 200 x 10^6 m/s.
The one-way delay to Boston is 4320 km / 200 x 10^6 m/s = 21.6ms.
The round-trip time to Boston and back is 43.2ms.
The current ping time from Stanford to Boston over today’s Internet is about 85ms (…)
So: the hardware of the Internet can currently achieve within a factor of two of the speed of light.

The cited 85ms round-trip time between Boston and Stanford will certainly improve over time, and your own experiments right now might already show it. But it’s important to note that there’s a theoretical minimum of about 50ms between the two coasts.

The bandwidth capacity of your users’ connections might improve noticeably, as it steadily has, but the latency needle won’t move much at all. This means that minimizing the number of roundtrips you make to display information on page is essential to great user experience and responsiveness.

This becomes particularly relevant to point out considering the rise of JavaScript-driven applications that usually consist of no markup other than <script> and <link> tags beside an empty <body>. This class of application has received the name of “Single Page Applications” or “SPA”. As the name implies, there’s only one page the server consistently returns, and all the rest is figured out by your client side code.

Consider the scenario where the user navigates to http://app.com/orders/ after following a link or typing in the URL. At the time your application receives and processes the request, it already has important information about what’s going to be shown on that page. It could, for example, pre-fetch the orders from the database and include them in the response. In the case of most SPAs, a blank page and a <script> tag is returned instead, and another roundtrip will be made to get the scripts contents. So that then another roundtrip can be made to get the data needed for rendering.

Analysis of the HTML sent by the server for every page of a SPA in the wild
Analysis of the HTML sent by the server for every page of a SPA in the wild

At this point many developers consciously accept this tradeoff because they make sure the extra network hops happen only once for their users by sending the proper cache headers in the script and stylesheet responses. The general consensus is that it’s an acceptable tradeoff because once the bundle is loaded, you can then handle most of the user interaction (like transitions to other pages) without requesting additional pages or scripts.

However, even in the presence of a cache, there’s a performance penalty when considering script parsing and evaluation time. “Is jQuery Too Big For Mobile?” describes how even for jQuery alone this could be in the order of hundreds of milliseconds for certain mobile browsers.

What’s worse, usually no feedback whatsoever is given to the user while the scripts are loading. This results in a blank page displaying and then a sudden transition to a fully loaded page.

Most importantly, we usually forget that the current prevailing transport of internet data (TCP) starts slowly. This pretty much guarantees that most script bundles won’t be fetched in one roundtrip, making the situation described above even worse.

A TCP connection starts with an initial roundtrip for the handshake. If you’re using SSL, which happens to be important for safe script delivery, an additional two roundtrips are used (only one if the client is resuming a session). Only then can the server start sending data, but as it turns out, it does so slowly and incrementally.

A congestion control mechanism called slow start is built into the TCP protocol to send the data in a growing number of segments. This has two serious implications for SPAs:

Large scripts take a lot longer to download than it seems. As explained in the book “High Performance Browser Networking” by Ilya Grigorik, it takes “four roundtrips (…) and hundreds of milliseconds of latency, to reach 64 KB of throughput between the client and server”. In this example, considering a great internet connection between London and New York, it takes 225ms before TCP is able to reach the maximum packet size.
Since this rule applies also for the initial page download, it makes the initial content that comes rendered with the page all that much more important. As Paul Irish concludes in his presentation “Delivering the Goods”, the first 14kb are crucially important. This is a helpful illustration of the amount of data the server can send in each round-trip over time:

How many KB a server can send for each phase of the connection by segments.
How many KB a server can send for each phase of the connection by segments

Websites that deliver content (even if it’s only the basic layout without the data) within this window will seem extremely responsive. In fact, to many authors of fast server-side applications JavaScript is deemed unneeded or as something to be used sparingly. This bias is further strengthened if the app has a fast backend and data sources and its servers located near users (CDN).

The role of the server in assisting and speeding up content presentation is certainly application-specific. The solution is not always as straightforward as “render the entire page on the server”.

In some cases, parts of the page that are not essential to what the user is likely after are better left out of the initial response and fetched later by the client. Some applications, for example, opt to render the “shell” of the page to respond immediately. Then they fetch different portions of the page in parallel. This allows for great responsiveness even in a situation with slow legacy backend services. For some pages, pre-rendering the content that’s “above the fold” is also a viable option.

Making a qualitative assessment of scripts and styles based on the information the server has about the the session, the user and the URL is absolutely crucial. The scripts that deal with sorting orders will obviously be more important to /orders than the logic to deal with the settings page. Maybe less intuitively, one could also make a distinction between “structural CSS” and the “skin/theme CSS”. The former might be required by the JavaScript code, so it should block, but the latter could be loaded asynchronously.

A neat example of a SPA that does not incur in extra roundtrip penalties is a proof-of-concept clone of StackOverflow in 4096 bytes (which can theoretically be delivered on the first post-handshake roundtrip of a TCP connection!). It manages to pull this off at the expense of cacheability, by inlining all the assets within the response. With SPDY or HTTP/2 server push, it should be theoretically possible to deliver client code that’s cacheable in a single hop. For the time being, rendering part or all of the page on the server is the most common solution to avoiding extra roundtrips.

A flexible enough system that can share rendering code between browser and server and provides tools for progressively loading scripts and styles will probably eliminate the colloquial distinction between websites and webapps. Both are reigned by the same UX principles. A blog and a CRM are fundamentally not that different. They have URLs, navigation, they show data to the user. Even a spreadsheet application, which traditionally relies a lot more on client side functionality, first needs to show the user the data he’s interested in modifying. And doing so in the least number of network roundtrips is paramount.

In my view, the major tradeoffs in performance seen in many widely deployed systems these days have to do with the progressive accumulation of complexity in the stack. Technologies like JavaScript and CSS were added over time. Their popularity increased over time as well. Only now can we appreciate the impact of the different ways they’ve been applied. Some of this is addressed by improving protocols (as shown by the ongoing enhancements seen in SPDY and QUIC), but the application layer is where most of the benefits will come from.

It’s helpful to refer to some of the initial discussions around the design of the initial WWW and HTML to understand this. In particular, this mailing list thread from 1997 proposing the addition of the <img> tag to HTML. Marc Andreessen re-iterates the importance of serving information fast:

“If a document has to be pieced together on the fly, it could get arbitrarily complex, and even if that were limited, we’d certainly start experiencing major hits on performance for documents structured in this way. This essentially throws the single-hop principle of WWW out the door (well, IMG does that too, but for a very specific reason and in a very limited sense) — are we sure we want to do that?”

 2. Act immediately on user input

tl;DR: JavaScript allows us to mask network latency altogether. Applying this as a design principle should even remove most spinners or “loading” messages from your applications. PJAX or TurboLinks miss out on opportunities to improve the perception of speed.
The first principle builds heavily on the idea of minimizing latency as the user interacts with your website.

That said, despite how much effort you invest into minimizing the back-and-forth between server and client, there’s a few things beyond your control. A theoretical lower bound given by the distance between your user and your server being the unescapable one.

Poor or unpredictable network quality being the other significant one. If the network connection is not great, packet re-transmission will occur. What you would expect to result in a couple roundtrips could end up taking several.

And in this lies JavaScript’s greatest strength towards improving UX. With client-side code driving user interaction, we are now able to mask latency. We can create the perception of speed. We can artificially approach zero latency.

Let’s consider the basic HTML web again for a second. Documents connected together through hyperlinks, or <a> tags. When any of them are clicked, the browser will make a network request that’ll take unpredictably long, then get and process its response and finally transition to the new state.

JavaScript allows to act immediately and optimistically on user input. A click on a link or button can result in an immediate reaction without hitting the network. A famous example of this is Gmail (or Google Inbox), where archiving an email will happen immediately on the UI while the server request is sent and processed asynchronously.

In the case of a form, instead of waiting for some HTML as a response after its submission, we can act right after the user presses enter. Or even better, like Google Search does, we can respond to the user holding down a key:

Google adapts its layout as soon as you hold down a key
Google adapts its layout as soon as you hold down a key

That particular behavior is an example of what I call layout adaptation. The basic idea is that the first state of a page “knows” about the layout of the next state, so it can transition to it before there’s any data to populate the page with. It’s “optimistic” because there’s still a risk that the data never comes and an error should be displayed instead, but that’s obviously rare.

Google’s homepage is particularly relevant to this essay because its evolution illustrates the first two principles we’ve discussed very clearly.

First of all, analyzing the packet dump of the TCP connection to www.google.com reveals they make sure to send their entire homepage all at once after the request comes in. The whole exchange, including closing the connection, takes 64ms for me in San Francisco. This has likely been the case ever since the beginning.

In late 2004, Google pioneered the usage of JavaScript to provide inline as-you-type suggestions (curiously, as a 20% time project, like Gmail). This even became an inspiration for coining AJAX:

Take a look at Google Suggest. Watch the way the suggested terms update as you type, almost instantly … with no waiting for pages to reload. Google Suggest and Google Maps are two examples of a new approach to web applications that we at Adaptive Path have been calling Ajax

And in 2010 they introduced Instant Search, which puts JS front and center by skipping the page refresh altogether and transitioning to the “search results” layout as soon as you press a key as we saw above.

Another prominent example of layout adaptation is most likely in your pocket. Ever since the early days, iPhone OS would request app authors to provide a default.png image that would be rendered right away, while the actual app was loading.

iPhone OS enforced loading default.png before the application
iPhone OS enforced loading default.png before the application

In this case, the OS was compensating not necessarily for network latency, but CPU. This was crucial considering the constraints of the original hardware. There’s however a scenario where this technique breaks. That would be when the layout doesn’t match the stored image, as in the case of login screens. A thorough analysis of its implications was provided by Marco Arment in 2010.

Another form of input besides clicks and form submissions that’s greatly enhanced by JavaScript rendering is file input.

We can capture the user’s intent to upload through a variety of means: drag and drop, paste, file picker. Then, thanks to new HTML5 APIs we can display content as if it had been uploaded. An example of this in action is in the work we did with Cloudup uploads. Notice how the thumbnail is generated and rendered immediately:

The image gets rendered and fades in before the upload completes
The image gets rendered and fades in before the upload completes

In all of these cases, we’re enhancing the perception of speed. Thankfully, there’s plenty of evidence that this is a good idea. Consider the example of how increasing the walk to baggage claim reduced the number of complaints at the Houston Airport, without necessarily making baggage handling faster.

The application of this idea should have very profound implications on the UI of our applications. I contend that spinners or “loading indicators” should become a rarity, especially as we transition to applications with live data, discussed in the next section.

There’s situations where the illusion of immediacy could actually be detrimental to UX. Consider a payment form or a logout link. Acting optimistically on those, telling the user everything is done when it’s not, can result in a negative experience.

But even in those cases, the display of spinners or loading indicators should be deferred. They should only be rendered after the user no longer considers the response was immediate. According to the often-cited research by Nielsen:

The basic advice regarding response times has been about the same for thirty years Miller 1968; Card et al. 1991:
0.1 second is about the limit for having the user feel that the system is reacting instantaneously, meaning that no special feedback is necessary except to display the result.
1.0 second is about the limit for the user’s flow of thought to stay uninterrupted, even though the user will notice the delay. Normally, no special feedback is necessary during delays of more than 0.1 but less than 1.0 second, but the user does lose the feeling of operating directly on the data.
10 seconds is about the limit for keeping the user’s attention focused on the dialogue. For longer delays, users will want to perform other tasks while waiting for the computer to finish

Techniques like PJAX or TurboLinks unfortunately largely miss out on the opportunities described in this section. The client side code doesn’t “know” about the future representation of the page, until an entire roundtrip to the server occurs.

 3. React to data changes

tl;DR: When data changes on the server, let the clients know without asking. This is a form of performance improvement that frees the user from manual refresh actions (F5, pull to refresh). New challenges: (re)connection management, state reconciliation.
The third principle is that of reactivity of the UI with respect to data changes in the source, typically one or more database servers.

Serving an HTML snapshot of data that remains static until the user refreshes the page (traditional websites) or interacts with it (AJAX) is increasingly becoming obsolete.

Your UI should be self-updating.

This is crucially important in a world of an ever-increasing number of data points, in the form of watches, phones, tablets and wearable devices yet to be designed.

Consider the Facebook newsfeed at the time of its inception, when data was primarily entered through personal computers. Rendering it statically was not optimal, but it made sense if people were updating their profiles maybe once a day, if that.

We now live in a world where you can upload a photo, and have your peers like it or comment on it almost immediately. The need for realtime feedback is natural due to the highly concurrent usage of the application.

It would be wrong, however, to assume that the benefits of reactivity are limited to multi-user applications. Which is why I like to talk about  concurrent data points as opposed to users. Consider the common scenario of sharing a photo you have on your phone with your own laptop:

A single-user application can still benefit from reactivity
A single-user application can still benefit from reactivity

It’s useful to think of all the data exposed to the user as reactive. Session and login state synchronization is an example of applying this principle uniformly. If users of your application have multiple tabs open simultaneously, logging out of one will invalidate them all. This inevitably results in enhanced privacy and security, especially in situations where multiple people have access to the same device.

Each page reacts to the session and login state
Each page reacts to the session and login state

Once you set up the expectation that the information on the screen updates automatically, it’s important to consider a new need: state reconciliation.

When receiving ordered atomic data updates, it’s easy to forget that your application should be able to update appropriately even after long periods of disconnection. Consider the scenario of closing your laptop’s lid and reopening it days later. What how does your app behave then?

Example of what would occur if we disregard elapsed time upon reconnection
Example of what would occur if we disregard elapsed time upon reconnection

The ability for your application to reconcile states disjointed in time is also relevant to our first principle. If you opt to send data with the initial page load, you must consider the time the data is on the wire until your client-side scripts load. That time is essentially equivalent to a disconnection, and the initial connection by your scripts is a session resumption.

 4. Control the data exchange with the server

tl;DR: We can now fine-tune the data exchange with the server. Make sure to handle errors, retry on behalf of the user, sync data on the background and maintain offline caches.
When the WWW was conceived, data exchange between the client and server was limited to a few ways:

clicking a link would GET a new page and render the new page
submitting a form would POST or GET and render a new page
embedding an image or object would GET it asynchronously and render it
The simplicity of this model is attractive, and we certainly have a much higher learning curve today when it comes to understanding how data is sent and received.

The biggest limitations were around the second point. The inability to send data without necessarily triggering a new page load was not optimal from a performance standpoint. But most importantly, it completely broke the back button:


Possibly the most annoying artifact of the old web

The web as an application platform was thus inconceivable without JavaScript. AJAX constituted a leapfrog in terms of the user experience around user submission of information.

We now have a variety of APIs (XMLHttpRequest, WebSocket, EventSource to name a few) that give us fine-grained control of the data flow. In addition to the ability to send data the user inputs into a form, we now have some new opportunities to enhance UX.

One that’s specially relevant to our previous principle is the ability to display the connection state. If we set up the expectation that the data updates automatically, we ought to notify the user about being disconnected and ongoing reconnection attempts.

When detecting a disconnection, it’s useful to store data in memory (or even better, localStorage) so that it can be sent later. This is specially important in light of the introduction of ServiceWorker, which enables JavaScript web applications to run in the background. If your application is not open, you can still attempt to sync user data in the background.

Consider timeouts and errors when sending data and retry on behalf of the user. If a connection is re-established, attempt to send the data again. In the case of a persistent failure, communicate it to the user.

Certain errors should be handled carefully. For example, an unexpected 403 could mean the user’s session has been invalidated. In such cases, you have the opportunity to prompt the user to resume it by showing a login screen.

It’s also important to make sure the user doesn’t inadvertently interrupt the data flow. This can happen under two situations. The first and most obvious one is closing the browser or tab, which you can attempt to prevent with beforeunload handlers.


The beforeunload browser warning

The other (and less obvious) one is capturing page transitions before they happen, like clicking links that trigger a new page load. This gives you a chance to display your own modals.

 5. Don’t break history, enhance it

tl;DR: Without the browser managing URLs and history for us, new challenges emerge. Make sure not to break expectations related to scrolling. Keep your own caches for fast feedback.
Form submissions aside, if we were to design any modern web application with only hyperlinks, we’d end up with fully functional back/forward navigation.

Consider, for example, the typical “infinite pagination scenario”. The typical way it’s implemented involves capturing the click with JavaScript, requesting some data / HTML, injecting it. Making the history.pushState or replaceState call is an optional step, unfortunately not taken by many.

And this is why I use the word “break”. With the simpler model the web proposed initially, this situation was not in the picture. Every state transition relied on a URL change.

The flip side of this is that new opportunities emerge for enhancing history now that we can control it with JavaScript.

One such opportunity is what Daniel Pipius dubbed Fast Back:

Back should be quick; users don’t expect data to have changed much.

This is akin to considering the back button an application-level button and applying principle 2: act immediately on user input. The key is that you can now decide how to cache the previous page and render it instantly. You can then apply principle 3 and then inform the user of new data changes that happened to that page.

There’s still a few cases where you won’t be in control of the caching behavior. For example, if you render a page, then navigate to a third party website, and the user clicks back. Applications that render HTML on the server and then modify it on the client are at particular risk of this subtle bug:


Pressing back incorrectly loads the initial HTML from the pageload

Another way of breaking navigation is by ignoring scrolling memory. Once again, pages that don’t rely on JS and manual history management most likely won’t have an issue with this. But dynamic ones usually do. I tested the two most popular JavaScript-driven newsfeeds of the web: Twitter and Facebook. Both exhibited scrolling amnesia.


Infinite pagination is usually susceptible to scrolling amnesia

Finally, be aware of state changes that are relevant only while navigating history. Consider this example of toggling the display of comment subtrees.


The toggling of comments should be preserved when navigating history

If the page was re-rendered by following a link within the application, the expectation of the user might be that all comments appear uncollapsed. The state was volatile and only associated with the entry in the history stack.

 6. Push code updates

tl;DR: Pushing data without pushing code is insufficient. If your data updates automatically, so should your code. Avoid API errors and improve performance. Use stateless DOM for side-effect free repainting.
Making your application react to code changes is crucially important.

First of all, it reduces the surface for possible errors and increases reliability. If you make a breaking change to your backend APIs, then clients’ code must be updated. They might otherwise not be able to understand new data, or they may send data in an incompatible format.

Another equally important reason has to do with the implementation of principle #3. If your UI is self-updating, there’s little reason for users to trigger a page refresh.

Keep in mind that in a traditional website, a page refresh accomplishes two things: reload the data and reload the code. Setting up a mechanism to push data without one to push code is not enough, especially in a world where a single tab (session) might stay open for a very long time.

If a server push channel is in place, a notification can be emitted to clients when new code is available. In the absence of that, a version number can be appended as a header to outgoing HTTP requests. The server can then compare it to its latest known version, opt to handle request or not, and advice the client.

After this, some web applications opt to refresh the page on behalf of the user when deemed appropriate. For example, if the page is not visible and no form inputs are filled out.

A better approach is to perform hot code reloading. This means that there would be no need to perform a full page refresh. Instead, certain modules can be swapped on the fly and their code re-executed.

It’s certainly hard to make hot code reloading work for many existing codebases. It’s worth discussing then a type of architecture that elegantly separates behavior (code) from data (state). Such a separation would allow us to make a lot of different patches very efficient.

Consider for example a module in your application that sets up an event bus (e.g: socket.io). When events are received, the state of a certain component is populated and it renders to the DOM. Then you modify the behavior of that component, for example, so that it produces different DOM markup for existing and new state.

The ideal scenario is that we’re able to update the code on a per-module basis. It wouldn’t make sense to restart the socket connection, for example, if we can get away with just updating the modified component’s code. Our ideal architecture for hot-code pushing is thus modular.

But the next challenge is that modules should be able to be re-evaluated without introducing undesirable side effects. This is where an architecture like the one proposed by React comes particularly handy. If a component code is updated, its logic can be trivially re-executed and the DOM efficiently updates. An exploration of this concept by Dan Abramov can be found here.

In essence, the idea that you render to the DOM (or paint it) is what significantly helps with hot code swapping. If state was kept in the DOM, or event listeners where set up manually by your application, updating code would become a much more complicated task.

 7. Predict behavior

tl;DR: Negative latency.
A rich JavaScript application can have mechanisms in place for predicting the eventual user input.

The most common application of this idea is to preemptively request data from the server before an action is consummated. Starting to fetch data when you hover a hyperlink so that it’s ready when it’s clicked is a straightforward example.

A slightly more advanced method is to monitor mouse movement and analyze its trajectory to detect “collisions” with actionable elements like buttons. A jQuery example:

jQuery plugin that predicts the mouse trajectory
jQuery plugin that predicts the mouse trajectory

 Conclusion

The web remains one of the most versatile mediums for the transmission of information. As we continue to add more dynamism to our pages, we must ensure that we retain some of its great historical benefits while we incorporate new ones.

Pages interconnected by hyperlinks are a great building block for any type of application. Progressive loading of code, style and markup as the user navigates through them will ensure great performance without sacrificing interactivity.

New unique opportunities have been enabled by JavaScript that, once universally adopted, will ensure the best possible user experience for the broadest and freest platform in existence.

You Are Solving The Wrong Problem


There is some problem you are trying to solve. In your life, at work, in a design. You are probably solving the wrong problem. Paul MacCready, considered to be one of the best mechanical engineers of the 20th century, said it best: “The problem is we don’t understand the problem.”

Story time.

It’s 1959, a time of change. Disney releases their seminal film Sleeping Beauty, Fidel Castro becomes the premier of Cuba, and Eisenhower makes Hawaii an official state. That year, a British industry magnate by the name of Henry Kremer has a vision that leaves a haunting question: Can an airplane fly powered only by the pilot’s body power? Like Da Vinci, Kremer believed it was possible and decided to push his dream into reality. He offered the staggering sum of £50,000 for the first person to build a plane that could fly a figure eight around two markers one half-mile apart. Further, he offered £100,000 for the first person to fly across the channel. In modern US dollars, that’s the equivalent of $1.3 million and $2.5 million. It was the X-Prize of its day.



Paul MacCready holding a “Speed Ring”, a device he invented for competitive glider flying.

Thanks to Alan Kay for turning me on to this story.

A decade went by. Dozens of teams tried and failed to build an airplane that could meet the requirements. It looked impossible. Another decade threatened to go by before our hero, MacCready, decided to get involved. He looked at the problem, how the existing solutions failed, and how people iterated their airplanes. He came to the startling realization that people were solving the wrong problem. “The problem is,” he said, “that we don’t understand the problem.”

MacCready’s insight was that everyone working on solving human-powered flight would spend upwards of a year building an airplane on conjecture and theory without the grounding of empirical tests. Triumphantly, they’d complete their plane and wheel it out for a test flight. Minutes later, a years worth of work would smash into the ground. Even in successful flights, a couple hundred meters later the flight would end with the pilot physically exhausted. With that single new data point, the team would work for another year to rebuild, retest, relearn. Progress was slow for obvious reasons, but that was to be expected in pursuit of such a difficult vision. That’s just how it was.

The problem was the problem. Paul realized that what we needed to be solved was not, in fact, human powered flight. That was a red-herring. The problem was the process itself, and along with it the blind pursuit of a goal without a deeper understanding how to tackle deeply difficult challenges. He came up with a new problem that he set out to solve: how can you build a plane that could be rebuilt in hours not months. And he did. He built a plane with Mylar, aluminum tubing, and wire.



The first airplane didn’t work. It was too flimsy. But, because the problem he set out to solve was creating a plane he could fix in hours, he was able to quickly iterate. Sometimes he would fly three or four different planes in a single day. The rebuild, retest, relearn cycle went from months and years to hours and days.

18 years had passed since Henry Kremer opened his wallet for his vision. Nobody could turn that vision into an airplane. Paul MacCready got involved and changed the understanding of the problem to be solved. Half a year later later, MacCready’s Gossamer Condor flew 2,172 meters to win the prize. A bit over a year after that, the Gossamer Albatross flew across the channel.

What’s the take-away? When you are solving a difficult problem re-ask the problem so that your solution helps you learn faster. Find a faster way to fail, recover, and try again. If the problem you are trying to solve involves creating a magnum opus, you are solving the wrong problem.

WHY YOU DON’T NEED DEVICE SPECIFIC BREAKPOINTS

BY JUSTIN AVERY, 28 OCT 2014 : OPINION

With the ever growing number of different mobile, tablet, laptops, monitors, televisions, watches — and whatever else will communicate information to you visually — it's finally time to put to rest those device specific breakpoints.

Recently I was fortunate to spend some time with Brad Frost. One of our conversations — most of which weren't anything to do with the industry — was around the need to upgrade to the latest round of devices (the iPhone 6 had recently been released).

I was joking about coming across my first iPad (2011 iPad 2) and how comically large it seemed after using the iPad Mini. With so many new devices that were now hitting the shelves and the fact that we're no longer wowed that there's a new bigger and skinnier phone has meant that for some the upgrade to the latest version isn't something that is as vital as it once was.

DESIRE TO UPGRADE

One of the reasons behind wanting to upgrade to the latest device was the need to start testing our own and our client websites to see what we needed to fix.

With the iPhone 6 new larger screen, and it's companions 6+ even bigger screen this would surely introduce a new set of design problems for all the sites we only launched since the iPhone 5 resize.

Surely this, along with the High DPI Screen was going to warrant us to head out and upgrade to the latest bit of hardware.

RESPONSIVE DESIGN AT ITS BEST

The fact is that we didn't need to do anything.

Nothing. Nada. Zip.

Over the past 4 years (that's right, the idea has been around for that long and it's not going anywhere) we've been moving towards a more responsive web. We have flexible grids, we have flexible images, and we use media queries to rearrange our layouts when the viewport dictates.

Over the 4 years we have slowly moved away from device specific breakpoints in favour of content specific breakpoints, i.e. adding a breakpoint when the content is no longer easy to consume.

With this fundamental shift in thinking we no longer have to fear a new device — a new iPhone width — because we've already fixed our sites to work everywhere.

Lets take a look at three of the most common issues with new widths and why they no longer matter.

FORM FACTOR

This is actually a good reason for testing. The size of the phone has increased and therefore the way we interface with the phone will change. Luke Wroblewski has written about the form factor and possible solutions to navigation.

This is nothing new though. There have been larger phones on the market since the Samsung Note was released so many of the issues faced will have already been overcome.

Apple have released a double tap on the home button to move the top of the screen closer for tapping elements, but this form factor is not available across all devices so not something that provides a well rounded solution.

Form factor doesn't matter because you've already taken these screen sizes into consideration with other devices.

HIGH DPI

When the retina display (Apples marketing name for high DPI screens) was released it caused a world wide panic. First there was 1.5 high dpi which meant you needed a 38px icon to render nice and crisp when displayed at 25px. Then we had the 2x icon sizes and we needed a 50px icon to render nice and crisp when displayed at 25px.

At some point we got bored or resizing icons and worked out that if we used Font Icons or SVG icons then it didn't matter how good the screen would become because the vector looks beautiful and crisp EVERYWHERE.

High DPI/Retina doesn't matter because you've already updated all your logo's and icons to SVG and that scales to work on any device.

NEW VIEWPORT DIMENSIONS

For a little while we lost site of what Responsive Design really meant — and I mean the underlying theory of Responsive Design where we respond our content to fit any viewport — and we began to use device widths to target particular layouts towards.

We knew that browser and device sniffing was frowned upon and thought that we could achieve the same approach using only media queries. This spurred the 320, 480, and 768px media queries that kept with the iPhone 3/4 and iPad viewport dimensions. When the iPhone 5 was released a handful of use updated the 480px query to 568px to accommodate the slightly larger screen. Strangely we never looked at Android phone dimensions (probably because there's far too many of them).

Fortunately at some point we all became aware we were doing it wrong and fell back to allowing the content dictate our breakpoints. This has the greatest benefit of all, the ability to still serve our sites content perfectly regardless of the device sizes released to market.

New device size don't matter because you've already based your media query breakpoints on the content.

THE FUTURE

This won't be the last iPhone to be released, and it certainly won't be the last smart phone released with a new dimension.

Fortunately it no longer matters the size of the devices that are coming in the future because we're already prepared for them with our flexible grids, flexible images, and content focussed breakpoints.

The picture proposal has meant that in the future image sizes are no longer an issue either, although we do need to become better at setting the sizes attribute.

The biggest issue we're going to have now will be producing content for smaller screens. Screens that fit on your wrist. This is a problem less for responsive design to solve, after all we can't reduce the content to less than a single column.

Instead the solution will be in the format we serve our content. Making it available not just in between <html>..</html> tags, but also in formats like <xml> <rss> and json.




04. The decline of the website

Have you noticed the gradual decline in the role of the website? Take for example going to see a movie. You know what you want to see, but you don’t know where it is showing.

In the past you would have visited each movie theatre website one at a time to see if they were showing the film you wanted. Each website was different, crafted by a busy team of web designers.

My betting is that is not how you look up movies anymore. The chances are you have a single app on your mobile that aggregates movie listings from many sources. Perhaps you even ask Siri or just Google it.

Web design trends for 2015
Who needs websites when you have Siri?
This creates a much better experience as users don't have to deal with different interfaces. Unfortunately it does start to undermine the role of the designer crafting these different sites.

I am sure it won't be long before you ask Siri and she tells you when and where your film is on. The whole thing done by voice command, no user interface at all.

Content is being set free from design. Instead we are sharing content via APIs between applications and sites. Sometimes business owners are choosing to put their content on Facebook, Yelp or Foursquare. They are abandoning the idea of having their own site. This is something that is particularly prevalent in China.

http://thetomorrowlab.com/2015/01/why-developers-hate-being-interrupted/

Interruptions are to developers what kryptonite is to Superman—they kill productivity and there’s a significant recovery period.

There are two types of interruption: the planned meeting and the one where someone walks over to your desk to talk to you (or if you’re unlucky enough to have a desk phone it’s when the phone rings). The random interruption is akin to walking up to a someone building a lego tower, kicking it over and expecting them to continue from where they were the moment before you arrived. The planned meeting is a lot longer and kills productivity before, not just during and after. So, there are two types of problem that need addressed here.

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A DEVELOPER IS INTERRUPTED?
A huge amount of what a developer is doing is in their head. As we write code we need to keep a mental model of how parts of the application that have already been written and are yet to be written interact with the part that we are writing at that moment. We need to have a solid picture of exactly how the code is working as a whole and maintain that picture. It’s not easy, it requires a lot of concentration and has to remain in place while we think of creative and efficient ways to solve the problem at hand.

Developers can appear very unproductive at times, sitting staring at the screen with our headphones on and very little in the way of keyboard clackety-tap. This however is when we are doing our thinking, when we are building up, adding to and rearranging the mental model of how our code will work. This is the biggest and hardest part of development.

Imagine how it feels to have that interrupted at random by a telephone call or somebody walking over to talk to you. It’s horrible.

This picture explains it very well.

The thing about this mental model is that it takes about an hour to build up from a cold start (first thing in the morning, after lunch or after a meeting). Thankfully that’s not the case after a five minute interruption from a boss or account manager. In that case it takes 10-15 minutes before a developer is back “in the zone” with a repaired mental model and ready to write some more code.

That’s still not great—we only need 4 or 5 small interruptions for an hour to be lost.

Scheduled meetings don’t bring the mental modal crashing down the way smaller interruptions do, but they have a significant impact. We know the meeting is taking place so we can stop where there’s a natural break point in our work and prepare for the meeting. Not such a huge problem there.

Where it becomes a problem is if the meeting is scheduled for an hour or so after lunch or arriving in the office. Remember that it takes about an hour to be in a position to write code after a longer break. Combine that with the fact that nobody can write much code in less than an hour, so anything that leaves a developer with less than two hours is probably going to mean it’s not worth the effort to get started only to stop and have to get started again afterwards.

There’s one more thing, a theory by developer come venture capitalist Paul Graham called Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule. In it Graham posits that managers are on a different schedule to makers and that is the root of the problem. Interruptions are the symptom.

It’s a good article and well worth reading. I feel it’s well summarised by two early paragraphs:

Most powerful people are on the manager’s schedule. It’s the schedule of command. But there’s another way of using time that’s common among people who make things, like programmers and writers. They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You can’t write or program well in units of an hour. That’s barely enough time to get started.

When you’re operating on the maker’s schedule, meetings are a disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in. Plus you have to remember to go to the meeting. That’s no problem for someone on the manager’s schedule. There’s always something coming on the next hour; the only question is what. But when someone on the maker’s schedule has a meeting, they have to think about it.

The upshot of all of this is that developers often end up working late at night when there is no chance of an interruption and we know we can really get stuck into a project. Obviously this is not ideal. Developers are no more able to cope with a lack of sleep than anyone else, especially as we get past our twenties.

REDUCING INTERRUPTIONS
So what practical measures can we take to alleviate this?

Toby Osbourn has written a fantastic article on the subject of small interruptions and one of the things he highlights is the need for developers to turn off the interruptions we create ourselves like having our phone on a stand under our monitor, distracting us with every text, call, tweet and whatever other notifications it has turned on.

Desktop notifications need to go too. Close that email client and get rid of any browser tabs that aren’t related to the task in hand.

Here at The Tomorrow Lab we have a headphones rule. If a developer has headphones on or in both ears they cannot be disturbed. If only one ear has music then they can be disturbed about work. It’s been in place for a good while but for 2015 we decided to formalise it in the form of a poster on the wall, and you can download it to print if you like!

Another thing Osbourn suggests is moving somewhere else such as a coffee shop or working from home. Thankfully here at The Tomorrow Lab we can work from home frequently but moving out of the office is not something that would work for us over extended periods of time. There’s a lot of collaborative work with other members of the team on design, digital marketing, sales and with each other that we need to be in the office for.

The key thing for me though is communication with interrupters. They will never know how they affect our productivity unless we tell them. They spend all day doing their job and aren’t going to find out via telepathy that what they are doing is having a negative influence on how we do ours. Another system we are prototyping here is a timetable or quota of time when everybody has to stay away from developers unless there is a serious problem with a live site. We can’t impose this on account managers and directors so we need to work with them, effectively communicating why such a system needs to be in place and how it benefits the whole company.

That’s all fine for small interruptions, what about planned meetings? We can’t just take a laptop to a coffee shop to avoid meetings we’re supposed to be at. Meetings are a necessary evil. (Granted they are usually last twice as long as they need to which is a separate issue.)

To be honest we’re not sure the best way to tackle this one. We conducted an internal survey asking 4 questions:

What time(s) of day do you feel most productive?
What time(s) of day would you rather have meetings at?
What/who are the worst interruptions you have to deal with?
Anything else you want to say on the subject of being interrupted?
The initial feedback would suggest we’re not going to keep everyone happy when scheduling meetings but there are some “hotspot” times i.e. times you don’t dare touch when organsing a meeting. These hotspot times are in addition to the first couple of hours in the morning and after lunch. On top of that we aren’t robots working in The Tomorrow Lab so we each have different start times and lunch times.

I think the best we can hope for is that nobody ends up feeling like they’re always in meetings right when they are most likely to solve a hard problem.

HOW TO DEAL WITH INTERRUPTIONS WHEN THEY HAPPEN
We’re talking about short interruptions here, the unplanned type. They will happen—hopefully less than before—but they will happen, and the aim when dealing with them is to preserve the structural integrity of the mental model as much as possible.

First of all split up the main problem into a list of smaller tasks, so instead of thinking something like, “Now where was I with the progressively enhanced accessible modal dialogue”, it’s more like, “Now where was I with updating the aria-hidden attribute”.

Secondly learn how to answer the interrupter with something polite along the lines of, “I can’t look at it right now, send me an email to remind me and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.” People will soon learn there’s not much point in interrupting you when they’ll just be going back to their desk to type out the same thing they were trying to tell you.

SUMMARY
Interruptions are a serious problem, they cause a huge amount in lost productivity, ergo money, and can make it very hard to get anything done. Working in a company where interruptions are guaranteed and nothing can be done about it is very demoralising. On the other hand, working in a company (*cough* like Tomorrow Lab *cough*) where you’re left to get on with your work is fantastic. It makes a developer feel like they can achieve something, it makes us look forward to going into work, it makes us feel fulfilled at the end of each day.

Developers don’t wear headphones because we enjoy music more than anyone else, it’s because headphones shut everything out and give us the mental space we need to build a very complicated model. (A lot of us view open plan offices as the worst invention of the 20th century!)

If you’re an interrupter and you get a terser response than you might have expected please don’t take it personally. We’re just aware of the model starting to loosen at the more precarious points and are getting frantic about the need to get back at work.

If you’re a developer and you’ve discovered some novel or interesting ways to reduce and/or deal with interruptions, please let us know in the comments.

Ever since version control systems such as Git have become widely-known and well-used, modern development processes have radically changed.

Here are some reasons why Git has the power to improve your development workflow.


Git Encourages Modularization
In even the smallest development projects, developers are often required to work on multiple components in parallel. Feature X, bug #102, a new UI for a sign-up form, etc.

Among many others, here are a couple of major issues with projects that aren’t version-controlled:

Project dependencies will be painful to manage. Team members must sort out which changes affect which components.
Unfinished and experimental code will mix-in with production-ready code. Without version control, there is a huge chance that an unstable piece of code gets deployed to a production environment.
Imagine these scenarios.

Your client tells you that they don’t want feature X anymore.

Or what if you find that feature Y — an experimental feature you have been working on — can’t be implemented?

How do you get code removed safely from your code base?

Using branches is the solution to these commonplace development problems. Although Git wasn’t the version control system (VCS) that introduced the concept of branching, it’s the first of its kind that makes it user-friendly.

Git Encourages Creativity and Experimentation
Git branching will improve your code-quality and productivity. It facilitates creativity and experimentation by removing your fear that the current version of the project will be affected while you are trying out ideas, giving you an environment where you can confidently explore and develop your project’s future features.

With Git, you can even create multiple branches that approach a given problem in different ways, test each of them with your master branch (the most current version of your project), and then choose the best option.

Git Allows You to Undo Your Mistakes
In Git, you can undo almost everything.

Being able to undo things gives your team the courage to try out ideas and concepts without the risk of breaking stuff, which in turn fosters a culture of innovation.

Git Makes Your Progress Clear
A commit in Git refers to the act of recording changes you have made in your source code.

When used properly, Git makes it easy to craft very granular commits. You can see what changes have occurred down to the microscopic level: Git will tell you what characters and lines in your source code have been altered. If you want to compare two versions of a file or the difference between two of your commits, you can issue Git’s diff command, which will highlight the differences between them.

A side note when using commits: As a good version control policy, I recommend that each commit should only contain changes that belong to a single topic.

For instance, if you’re fixing a specific bug — let’s call it bug #200 — that requires multiple source code changes across several files, all those changes should be under one commit in order for you to easily track changes to your project related to that bug. This way, you can document that "commit X fixed bug #200". A side benefit of this commit policy is, when you encounter another bug similar to bug #200 somewhere else in your project months from now, you can review how you resolved the first bug.

Mixing different topics in one commit makes it hard to see what things were added or resolved.

Also, multi-topic commits makes it more difficult to roll back to a previous version if you ever find the need to do so. Imagine a commit that contains changes for both feature A and feature B. If you find out later on that you introduced a severe security leak with feature B, you’ll have to roll back the code for both topics just to get rid of the problem.

You Can Work Offline
A lot of companies underestimate the benefits that can be had if their developers were to be able to work offline.

Being able to code on your laptop without having to connect to your company’s servers is not only about being able to work during a commute or while at home (which a lot of companies don’t permit due to security restrictions).

More importantly, being able to work offline makes you more fail-safe as a team: While with a VCS like Subversion or CVS, a developer can’t continue their work when a central server goes down, this is not an issue with Git.

In Git, developers can perform everything on their personal computer, making them independent of possible infrastructure downtimes.

Never Lose Data Ever Again
Losing data and not being able to recover it can break a dev project.

We’ve all heard or experienced our own set of horror stories about failed backups and servers. It’s good to know that when using Git, every developer working on a project has a full-fledged copy on their machine, including the project’s complete change history.

And if your team uses a remote source code repository such as GitHub, then the chances of losing your work in the event that your on-site backups fail is much smaller.

If your backups break down, losing data isn’t even a possibility when using Git: Just take any team member’s local repository and restore in minutes.

How to Use Git Today
Git has stepped out of being a technology for early-adopters. Today, more and more developers are using it to improve the quality of their code and workflow.
