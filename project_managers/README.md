# Project Managers

_Reading time ~ 2 hours, 15 minutes_

Your role is the most important. Not everyone can handle this role, but given that it touches on every part of the project, it's something that every web professional should try at some point and indeed many have, with Project Managers usually having previously been designers and developers. You are responsible for making sure the rest of the production team can do their jobs smoothly, for making sure the project actually gets produced, and produced to the best of your team's abilities. You are the enabler.

You may have noticed that this chapter is considerably longer than the others. While that may not be surprising for a chapter about project management in a book that's primarily about project management, it doesn't mean that the web project manager's workload is the weightiest or their tasks the most complex. You do, however, have the greatest number of responsibilities and different hats to wear. You are involved with everybody at every stage and so there are many approaches you can take.

Most people fall into web project management having previously worked in other roles, most commonly design or development. In some organisations roles are interchanged or rotated so that everyone gets a chance to be a project manager, thus giving everyone a greater commercial and logistical insight into the realities of running web projects, even businesses themselves. I like this idea. Some people will be weaker than others but they can garner support from everybody's shared experience. At the same time, being a project manager, even if only temporarily, adds value from new skills and knowledge, and generates confidence.

Project management is a careful balance of priorities weighted more towards clients, budgets, and schedules, but also concerned with product content, aesthetics, technologies, and performance. Rather than having a small number of things to work on at any one time, there are seemingly countless issues to deal with and numerous key decisions to make on a daily, even hourly, basis.

You're stuck there in the middle of everything, with demands made on you by the client or client manager, your boss, as well as the rest of the production team. They all want different things from you at all times and you have to try and keep them all happy. Of course, you are also making constant demands from all of them, the only difference being that they're probably less understanding, as dealing with interruptions isn't as much a part of their job as it is yours. In most cases, when you can be nice and organised, any and all interruptions can be scheduled to reduce their impact. But when it's inevitable, it helps to share an understanding of the combined pressures of budgeting, scheduling, request handling, and project planning. Thus the rest of the team learn that you have the best overview of the project and gain confidence that your decisions and interruptions are ultimately what's best for the project's success. After all, you must be doing something right if you keep delivering successful projects and work keeps coming in.

Unfortunately, as a natural consequence of your large and scattered workload, you can't be expected to always provide perfectly detailed, scoped, and unambiguous briefs and specifications, perfectly accurate costs and timelines, or tease out world-class design work and code. You can't be expected to please everyone all the time. But that of course is the goal and all you can ask for is trust that you're doing your best to work towards it. It's not easy, but hopefully by following some of the advice in this chapter you can be a happier, more productive, and more successful web project manager.

## Success Criteria

In order to perform this role well you'll need experience. In order to gain experience, you'll need to perform this role. However, maybe some other experience can help get you started. More often than not, web project managers have worked previously as designers, developers, account managers, testers, or IT technicians. All web projects are eventually delivered, but whether or not every part of the project is delivered in the best state highlights the value of the web project manager. If the project manager does indeed have a background in another role, it's often the case that that area, be it design or development or whatever, receives more than its fair share of attention. A designer may produce the most stunning UX features, at the expense of blowing the budget on laborious front-end development work. This is where the experience comes in. The longer people cover this role the more accustomed they become to balancing resources while maintaining scope, budget, timelines, and overall quality. To be truly effective, you need to be able to understand each role; you should embark on your own learning quest to ensure that you yourself can create content matrices, wire-frames, UI style guides, JavaScript functions, Test scripts etc.  If you can't then you will be relying on others to make your decisions for you or, worse, representing false expertise to those to whom you're accountable. So, if you're relatively new to this role, then don't worry - it will get easier, and you'll get better, even if you're great already. The way to stay monitor and constantly work on your performance is by being aware of your success measures, or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Your success measures may not be as obvious or easy to assess as those of, for example, a designer - analytics data - or developer - bug reports & analytics data - so we'll cover some ideas here.

The main idea behind KPIs is that they must be measurable metrics. Individual projects may have, indeed should have, their own KPIs to assess the extent to which the post-launch project has achieved it's initial pre-launch goals. The metrics recorded must be specific and consistent in order to allow for objective comparison.

Examples of good project KPIs might be:

* increase conversions by 5%
* reduce time spent by customer service responding to inquiries
* increase subscriptions
* generate 10% more traffic
* improve Google search results position for X keyword

Conversely bad KPIs are vague or difficult, if not impossible, to measure:

* increase brand awareness
* improve usability
* increase time spent on the website

We'll go further into establishing per-project KPIs later.

### Why KPIs are good

At the most basic level, having specific success measures, goals that you are working towards, help to maintain focus on what's important. You may pass on the requirements, make a timeline, meet your deadline, and deliver your project. But that doesn't count as a success if your production team are tired, angry, and resentful and your project of poor quality. This is only going to make your job harder on future projects. Aside from focus, KPIs are valuable in analysing mistakes or failures, allowing you to put measures in place to avoid them in future. If you know exactly what went wrong, you can fix it. 

### Your KPIs

#### Project KPIs

We've cover this more later, but having a set of consistent KPIs for each project, such as a performance budget or analytics targets, allows you to measure and compare on a per-project basis the success of your work. Doing increasingly better at meeting or exceeding project targets shows that you're doing something right. You might want to state an explicit target for each project, e.g. _Meet 100% of project KPIs_

#### Project Goals

Each project proposal should start with some explicit business goals. To what extent these goals have been met can be more difficult to measure and may rely on client feedback. You will certainly want to gather feedback from your client, so liaise with them directly or with your client manager. This KPI is about determining the happiness of the client or project owner. The happier they are, the better you and your team have performed. A concrete example might be: _“Achieve each and every primary and secondary objective”_, or _“Achieve a client satisfaction rating of 90%”_.

#### Timelines & Deadlines

This one is quite straightforward. Did you meet your deadlines? Did everything stay on schedule? E.g.

* _“Meet every deadline”_
* _“Provide agreed deliverables at the end of each week”_
* _“Extend final deadline by no more than 3 days”_

#### Bug Reports

This may not be a reliably comparable metric as each tester will have their own reporting methods, groups of testers may report duplicate issues, and different projects will invariably have different levels of complexity. Still, you may be able to find something you can monitor. How quickly can bugs be closed? How many bugs are reported on average? What kind of bugs are reported? How effective is the reporting? Aside from providing you with useful information to optimise processes, you may be able to extrapolate some information surrounding your team's effectiveness and productivity, which it is your responsibility to optimise.

#### Team Happiness & Productivity

This is exactly the kind of bad KPI mentioned above, being unspecific and seemingly impossible to measure. A major part of your role, however, is keeping your team happy and productive so it would be a good idea to try and find a way to measure the extent of your success (or failure) in this area. Some kind of survey is probably in order, certainly project review meetings, or “post mortems”.

### Staying Focused on the Problem

> “The problem is we don't understand the problem”

> -_Paul MacCready_

Your ultimate goal in this role is that you'll be able to easily look at a web project and envisage the whole solution in its entirety right from the start. You need to identify the problem and remain focused on it. You'll be able to see clearly what will be involved, be able to easily avoid or mitigate risks, and maintain momentum, until finally seeing through to a successful delivery. You'll understand the precise creative and technical requirements almost as well as any designer or developer. You'll be able to communicate with everyone in a clear and tailored way, speaking in their language such that they are left in no doubt as to the expectations and objectives. You'll keep the team motivated and focused on producing quality work, while shielding them from stress. You'll have no problems producing product plans, schedules, site-maps, wire-frames, and functional specifications that your production team can work from with ease.

## The Right Mindset

You control chaos with a strong determined smile and a tenacious attitude that means stuff can get done. You're also squeezed in the middle of various departments and levels of seniority, being pulled in different directions, into different environments, despite everyone working towards the same goal - the project being delivered successfully. So yeah... it's stressful... but it can also reward you with the greatest sense of accomplishment as you know more than anyone how much work has gone into putting the project together. Many people fail to appreciate just how many hats you have to wear or what skill it takes to accomplish your role, yet they all look to you to be the fountain of knowledge, to give them direction, help resolve problems, and be the steady rock while everyone else crumbles.

So how are you supposed you cope? It begins with honesty, trust, and integrity. No matter what you must stay calm and give everyone the cold hard facts throughout the life-cycle of each project. This will cement your position as a leader and will earn you respect from both the client or client manager as well as the rest of the production team. An environment of mutual respect is one that is much more conducive to a productive team and a truly excellent end product. There are many points in a project when you feel you may have to withhold or sugar-coat the truth. For example, explaining why a deliverable is late, telling a team member their work isn't up to scratch, or admitting that you yourself made a mistake. This will only serve to damage your relationships in the long-run, and your role is nothing if not dependent on solid relationships. It's always obvious when people are being false or obfuscatory. Telling the truth may hurt in the short term but it will help you build stronger relationships in the longterm. Once the client gets over their anger about the late delivery, they will at least know you have the courage to tell them bad news and will be more likely to trust what you tell them going forward. This is especially valuable for long-running projects.

Similarly integrity can be displayed by admitting responsibility for a mistake that you or a team member made, openly defending a client or team member, or insisting on maintaining quality standards, despite the pressure of looming deadlines. Having the fortitude to take the flak from angry clients isn't easy, adding an unneeded and undeserved surplus to your existing stress levels, but it will earn you reputation points. If on the other hand you fail to act with honesty and integrity as a project manager then eventually those you work with will wise up and start to treat you with mistrust, which will be incredibly damaging to all your projects.

Project managers all too often get the blame. Designers and developers may think they always agree to any and all client requests, no matter how preposterous, and just filter them down to those doing the real work, by which point it's too late to say no. Unfortunately, this blame is sometimes deserved. A big part of your job, and part of being honest and having integrity is standing up to the clients or client managers and rejecting requests if they are going to be too difficult, out of scope, a bad user experience, or jeopardise other parts of the project delivery. They are paying you to advise them, to tell them the cold hard facts, to protect them from poor decisions, even if it's not what they were hoping to hear. Situations when project managers might yield to such requests are when they don't have enough knowledge, experience, or confidence to challenge the request and suggest an alternative, or when they are simply feeling lazy. As a project manager you need to ensure you equip yourself with knowledge, experience, confidence, and motivation, exactly for situations like this. If you don't have the knowledge, admit this to your team; it's ok to not know about something as long as you're willing to learn, and maybe another team member could step in and fill your knowledge gap. If on the other hand it's a courage or confidence issue then fear not, for this is completely normal. To overcome that fear, practice your reasoning with other team members first to reinforce your decisions. Remember that part of your role is to provide expert consultation to the client while showing loyalty and dedication to your team. 

Sometimes, you will fail. There will be times when, perhaps due to circumstances beyond your control, you will have to accept bad requests and deliver them to your team. As with any other team-based role, one of the most important skills is empathy. First understand the request is going to piss people off; they are going to be resentful when they work on it. Also understand that this anger and resentment is a strong emotional reaction that means they actually care about what they do, which is a very good sign - they're not just being difficult. It's better to have a designer or developer angry about something with good cause than completely indifferent to everything, delivering as much or as little as required like a mindless automaton, incapable of innovation and passion, creating lacklustre project work. Recognise your team's frustration as passion and embrace it.

Earlier we mentioned mutual respect. When delivering work requests to your team, whether deemed good or bad, you need to offer an explanation along with it. Why we need to carry out this request, why you're assigning them, what your expectations are. No explanation and it's as if you're implying they don't care, can't understand, or that their opinions on the matter are not worth anything. Web designers and developers are highly skilled and intelligent people that will definitely understand, and want to understand, the background behind each request. If a request might at first appear a trifle waste of their time, then taking the time to explain your decision on why you've accepted the request may work to turn an atmosphere of resistance and frustration into one of acceptance and motivation. If you explain the history of the decision along with the rationale, then the same clever people you're asking to execute the request will hopefully realise that they too would make the same decision in your shoes.

Honesty, integrity, trust, empathy - the character traits of a great web project manager.

### Staying Positive

This is good general life advice. If you stay positive during a challenging time then it's more likely to yield a positive result. Conversely if you take a negative viewpoint then the chances of failure are maximised. This lesson is often misunderstood or abused in the workplace, resulting in short-term failure. Imagine a situation where a client makes a huge change request or imposes on you an unreasonable deadline, or where your production team entirely fail to deliver something promised. If you don't offer unconditional agreement, positive feedback or calm reassurance, then you may be labelled as being negative.

But maybe you are being negative. Maybe what's being asked of you and your team is actually feasible? Maybe you're dooming the challenge to failure before you've even tried? Part of your job is sometimes to provide negation, refusal, or denial, but always to avoid lacking positivity, lacking constructive criticism, or being miserable, gloomy, and unpleasant. We've all encountered negative people in this industry. There are those who are never positive about any project or strategy, and there are those who often come across as negative but are just being realistic and bravely speaking up while still pushing forward with the work. We're aiming to be the second type, of course. It's actually better to point out problems with ideas rather than always just trying to be blindly positive about everything, like some hipster valley entrpreneur who's already adopted the mentality that simply being positive means they will surely prevail. Sure, this mentality is infectious and makes for a much nicer, more motivational work environment. But being positive about everything can be dellusional - if everything is great then nothing needs to be fixed or improved. Sometimes you're just going to have to shit on people's _positive_ suggestions and requests with cold hard facts. There's not enough time, or money, or what they're asking can't be done, or it's really not a good idea because... etc. So by all means try and stay generally positive, but be prepared to be negative. How you handle your negativity situations will make or break you as a project manager though - either people will gradually resent you or come to respect your judgement. You can only learn through your mistakes so just keep making them and move forward.

### Being Nicely Negative

> A negative person is rarely positive, a realistic person is sometimes positive and sometimes not, but when not, always tries to get things into a state where they can feel positive about it as opposed to constantly ‘thinking positive’ and screwing up time and time again. Being realistic does not mean limiting your dreams; it simply means you make sensible steps to reaching them.

> -_Sam Barnes_

When it comes to disagreeing with people or expressing your concerns, never assume that they have the same level of understanding as you do. A client's request may seem so phenominally unreasonable to you that you may want to simply spontaneously combust and be done with it all. It's obviously not that unreasonable to them otherwise they wouldn't have asked, would they?

Remember that as the project manager you have the widest field of view over the entire project. You know your team and their capabilities. You know what they're working on, what they need to be productive, what their limits are. You know the project, what features it entails, when everything has to be completed by and what's needed to bring each part to completion. It comes back to empathy - you need to put yourself in their shoes and understand where their request or comment is coming from. Then you need to take some time out to think before you respond. Collect your thoughts, your knowledge, and experience, and determine whether the request is actually reasonable or the comment justified. Maybe your instincts are wrong on this one. You have the facts to hand so approach the problem calmy and logically and use them to justify your response. Take the problem, break it down into smaller chunks, and assess the time, money, and people situation to determine the path of least resistance. If you still can't find a way to make it work, after sincerely trying, then you have good reasoning to go back with. Once you have these cold hard facts then even those of the sunniest disposition won't be able to refute them.

But you're still at risk of coming across as a negative nancy. If you really disagree with something then it's not worth wasting time complaining about it unless you're willing to try and fix it or offer a reasonable solution. Part of your role is to solve problems just as much as it is the designer and developers'. Always follow up your dream-crushing facts with either a proposed solution or a forum where a solution can be derived, such as a meeting. Maybe you can find a spare resource, adopt some clever workarounds, get more money, or reframe the problem. Find a way to get positive about it again.

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls

Preparing for the worst should put you in a good position to deal with problems when they inevitably arise. Some projects seem endless, you often don't have enough resources, technical systems and tools break down, people get sick, clients or bosses try to micromanage, and sooner or later everything turns into a disaster. Web projects are confusing. The most common pitfall lies in miscommunication that serves to add to that confusion.

Never assume that you know better than the client or that you understand the pressures that they too are under. They may have superiors to report to or a team of stakeholders to juggle. Add to that they probably don't have as much experience as you with working on the web. While some of their requests may seem ridiculous to you, they are entirely serious. You have to resist the temptation to be condescending or patronising in any way but rather remain polite and helpful. Frame your replies to such a request in terms of previously agreed steps in the process, highlighting the tasks that you and your team are currently working on and how you will aim towards achieving the underlying goal behind the request. Coming back with useful and reassuring information not only satisfies the client but also provides them with something to go back to their own team with. 

Avoid using jargon. Always consider who you're speaking to and how best to communicate your message to them in their terms, without being patronising of course.

Don't submit to envy when you see others leaving work earlier than you or arriving later. There will inevitably be times when they are busier than you. You have the benefit of seeing an end to every project, you get recognition for successful deliveries, and you have clear success criteria, known targets, which perhaps others don't. It may seem like the client manager's job is to promise clients that which you have to deliver without even a clear idea if it's even possible, but in fact part of their job is to convince the client to go with your team, and at your costs, no matter what. Your plan is fixed and certain, based on specific tasks and goals, while those of others may not be. Always consider the situation others are in and try to cut them a little slack now and again. Never criticise unduly and when you do, make it constructive by offering helpful advice and trying to find a common ground. The alternative is to jeopardise relationships that you rely on and ultimately contribute to your already towering mountain of stress.

Resign yourself to the fact that there is a fixed, maybe even reduced budget. Also resign yourself to the fact that scope likely isn't fixed and is sooner to be expanded than reduced. Great! Unfortunately, this is just something you'll have to accept and move on. No point crying over spilt milk, as the saying goes. A truly great project manager will find a way to maximise the resources at hand to produce the optimum result, and that is the quintessential challenge of your role.

There are various tools and methods for dealing with this challenge. Primarily among them is by building a great team and cultivating relationships such that everyone helps eachother and works efficiently. Easy right? pfft. An easy way to give yourself some leeway is to always overestimate the time and money required. Overspend the budget, place deadlines beyond a date by which you know delivery is achievable. You may need to justify this on the basis that future projects for the same project owner will allow them to reclaim the overspend for the current one.

> Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge: Look, Mr. Scott, I'd love to explain everything to you, but the Captain wants this spectrographic analysis done by 1300 hours.

> Scotty: Do you mind a little advice? Starfleet captains are like children. They want everything right now and they want it their way. But the secret is to give them only what they need, not what they want.

> Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge: Yeah, well, I told the Captain I'd have this analysis done in an hour.

> Scotty: How long will it really take?

> Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge: An hour!

> Scotty: Oh, you didn't tell him how long it would *really* take, did ya?

> Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge: Well, of course I did.

> Scotty: Oh, laddie. You've got a lot to learn if you want people to think of you as a miracle worker.

Alternatively you can work to lower budgets than you actually have in order to cater in advance for the inevitable overrun. The best case is you deliver under budget and attain some internal process skills, and the worst case is that you deliver on budget. Either way, the project owner is going to be very happy and think you're a miracle worker. You may find pushback from your team, however, so you'll need to convince them of the Pareto Principle - that 80% of the project outcome is realised by only 20% of the work put in. If they can work more efficiently, making that 20% great, then maybe the rest isn't as important, so long as the client is satisfied. Much of that 80% is made up of review cycles and unplanned iterations.

However you decide to plan your project, make sure you involve your team from the start with open communication. Decide together how to share out laborious tasks, who can help who with what. You'll also need to keep your hands dirty throughout the project lifecycle. Get your hands dirty in the code, the copy, the images. Familiarise yourself with the strain of the boring and repetitive tasks. Understand the work and what you're asking of your team. Encourage everyone to divide their labour and share what they've learned. They should focus on high-concentration tasks for only an hour at a time, and review each other's work. Equip every project with tools and techniques than can be re-used along the way. Do your best to make it a team effort.

> It is a platitude that any kind of management only has two ways to get anything done – action and communication. Communication without action is simply pretending, and action without communication will never lead anywhere. Big gestures, speeches, or any other kind of ‘pep talk’ are not really well suited for motivating people’s participation without follow through.

> _- Michael Dlugosch_

It's all too easy to fall into narcism as a web project manager. We have so much to do. Our work is so important - without what we do everything else falls apart. We don't have time to keep people happy, we just need to get our work done and keep everything running as smoothly as possible both for the sake of the project... and, let's face it, our own comfort. We crave the reputation, the recognition, the status in the team. However if that's our primary concern then it will negatively impact the team's motivation for go the extra mile for us. A project manager must manage, and that means to lead, and to lead is to take action.

> Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.

> _- Master Yoda_

The most common pitfall is fear, and as Yoda said, it does indeed lead to anger and suffering. At the start of every project you know that things will go wrong. You'll struggle to meat a deadline, you'll have to deal with difficult client requests, even an unresponsive client, or your best developer may fall ill or go on holiday. Knowing this inevitability and still being unprepared for it is the web project manager's cardinal sin. You need to stay calm and anticipate how you're going to handle the situation. A good start is planning and documentation. Documenting everything, including communication, and having written contingencies in place will put everyone at ease when the time comes. An unreasonable demand doesn’t get any better, regardless of how often you repeat it. If the client or client manager is adamant about a particular request or feature that is beyond the agreed scope, then you must comprehensively document the interdependencies involved. Break the problem down into individual tasks. What is required for each task? Who will do the work? What will that require of other team members? What will the deliverables be? How long will it take? etc. This documentation will not only make implementation easier and put everyone on the same page, but will also be good to take back to the client to justify a spending increase or deadline delays.

Try and avoid any and all assumptions as much as possible. Using a particular tool or framework will not necessarily alleviate problems or reduce the time required, you can't rely on the developer to fix all reported bugs in a fixed time period before you know exactly what the bugs are. Try and identify all the likely points of failure well in advance. Most importantly, when things do go wrong, stay calm, stay polite, don't throw blame around, just find the best way to resolve the situation.

Going back to pre-emptively anticipating fear-inducing situations, one you'll surely have for at least one project during your time as a web project manager, if not every project, is resourcing issues. The client will expect you to be flexible enough to accommodate their delays in delivering materials or feedback without impacting final deadlines. You will be expected to allocate people to project work despite not having a clear grasp of the scope, and in the face of a slipping deadline and a shrinking budget. You must, however, **never** admit or even complain to anyone about not having enough resources. It will only serve to annoy your team, your client manager, your boss, the client, damaging relationships that you rely on. Furthermore, it's probably not entirely true even if you don't realise it. Unfortunately, it's usually your concern and nobody else's. The client certainly doesn't need to hear it - you don't expect to go into a restaurant as a customer, place your order, and then be told the chef can't cook your meal because they don't have the time or the ingredients. Instead you might be told that something is off the menu or that it will take time to prepare or be offered an alternative dish. You might change your order, you might go to another restaurant, or you might wait patiently and enjoy the meal that you are served.

There are some techniques you can employ to deal with resourcing issues when your team is stretched beyond its capability. Essentially though what they come down to is just buying time and accurately prioritising individual tasks. Luckily, as a project manager that's what you're best at. Never confirm or commit to anything until you've thoroughly checked it against budget and schedules. When new requests come in, they may actually improve on the agreed functionality or feature set to the point that they're really worth trying for the sake of the project's success, no matter the strain it will put you under. On the other hand if you can put a case for the increased time and money required the project owner may reconsider and deem it not worth it before withdrawing the request. You could try squeezing the requested work into the existing schedule, which would mean asking your team to work overtime in return for some promised compensation. Or you could just assign it to one person who you deem fit for the job, the hero who has to “take one for the team”. Alternatively you could rely on the advice and ingenuity of your team of experts. Make the task description as clear as possible and involve them in resolving the matter. Maybe there are other tasks that can be shuffled around, postponed, or better distributed. It's also important to consider what the task involves and therefore who would be capable of taking it on. Is it a specialist job or might you yourself be able to dip your hands in? Even if you're not entirely up to the task you may be able to seek help from a team member, learning something along the way and impressing them with your altruism. Or otherwise maybe everybody can chip in a little of their time so that everyone shares the load.

## Getting things done

> This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember: all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.

> -_Morpheus_

You arrive at the office at 0930 with your day fully planned out. You finish your caffeinated beverage, catch up on a few articles, and prepare to start work. It's 0950 and you've already received 10 e-mails, the client manager has been lingering around your desk, and you have a team of designers and developers waiting for your briefing before you can start work, all of which demands presidence over your scheduled work. Should have taken the blue pill.

One of the biggest challenges of project management is learning how to deal with several trillion things each day, approximately. Gone are the days of sitting down with a code editor and spending a day quietly tapping out some new algorithms, or playing around with typefaces on a blank canvas until you have that smug feeling of visual satisfaction. Every project is different. Every team is different. Yet somehow you have to stay on top of everything and maintain the steady pace of progress, like the burly drummer at the front of a dragon boat struggling through choppy waters.

One approach to this daunting challenge was conceived by David Allen and is accompanied by the tagline “The Art of Stress Free Productivity”. It probably won't leave you stress free - you're still a project manager and stress is par for the course - but you will certainly be more organised and equipped to deal with your gargantuan task list after adopting this system. While we're not going to cover the system in detail here - you may want to go get the book for that - we can at least go into a few points that are useful for web project managers specifically.

The main idea is to break down tasks into their smallest possible units, then organise and categorise them as “next actions” or “waiting for” items. This will help ensure you never forget to complete a task no matter how many other things you have to action, how long it's been since you last thought about it, or how small it is to other issues at hand. Everyone will want to spend time getting used to implementing this system and tweak it to their own ends. You'll need a tool like Gmail, Things, Evernote, or something capable of recording and categorising notes and tasks - devise your own system to do the following:

* Scan through all your emails at the start of the day. Anything that requires you to do something, mark it as a TODO (i.e. “next action”) and drag it to a TODO folder. 
* Anything that does not require an action should be read and archived into a project folder.
* If an e-mail contains something that requires you to wait for something from someone else before you can action it then categorise it as “waiting” and drag it to a WAITING folder.
* If an email contains something that you were waiting for, then immediately edit the corresponding item in the WAITING folder and then move it to the TODO folder.
* If an email can be replied to quickly and easily and will help someone else out or help move the project forward, then it's minimal effort from you so just reply immediately and instinctively, then archive it into the appropriate project folder, or if you need to wait for a reply then move it to the WAITING folder.


After doing this, you should have reached the fabled "inbox zero". Having an empty e-mail box does wonders for your stress levels, offering releif and a very real sense of accomplishment. Go get yourself another caffeinated beverage as a reward.

Now what?

Now you should go through your TODO list and prioritise them. The first item on your list each day should be the team briefing or daily standup meeting. We'll get to that later. Next thing is to go through your WAITING list to see if you need to send any reminders to anyone that they may be able to work on during the course of the day, allowing you to move the action to your TODO list as soon as possible. All that's left for the day is to go through your TODO list. If you get so many emails every day that you can't deal with them as they come in, or such that it would take too long to organise all your tasks within the first half hour of your day, then you may want to regroup in the afternoon and spend some more time going through your lists. List-making is the project manager's forté.

### Dealing with Interruptions

The client may call out of the blue, the client manager may still be lingering around your desk or bouldering over every 10 minutes. Your production team may be throwing questions at you left right and centre. Meanwhile, your eye keeps flicking towards your enormous TODO list. Stay calm.

There are two things to do here. First is to have your handy lists ready. Make a mental note of where you're at in what you're doing, stop, and give your time and full concentration to whoever is requesting it. Not only is it your job, but everyone will like you for it and be more understanding when you make demands on their precious time. With your lists at the ready, any actions that come up during your conversation can be put straight on the TODO list. At the end of the conversation why not take advantage of the situation and check through your WAITING list to see if there's anything this person can help you with? Maybe you can close off some issues that can help the project move forward. This will also clearly demonstrate to whoever you're dealing with that you are on top of the situation, giving them confidence in your project management capabilities.

### What You Need

#### Clear & Realistic Specifications

You've received the project specifications from the client or the client manager and you're starting to break it down into tasks and phases. It'll inevitably start to dawn on you that the deliverables are too ambiguous or that there doesn't seem to be enough time or budget or available skills to deliver the project successfully. Right now you're the only one that knows this and you get a lump in your throat. You're going to have to let the client know. Your immediate instinct is to push back or try to redefine the project scope. This is going to lose you some valuable trust points and give the client a negative impression of you right from the start.

You're going to need to try and resolve the situation and establish a project scope that you can confidently deliver. In other words, don't bitch and moan about it, but rather try one of the following to ensure you always get specifications that you can work with:

* Ensure that you are always involved in the pre-sales process
* Explain clearly and honestly the difficulty that the current scope puts you and your team in
* Meticulously track time spent on each project phase that the sales team or client manager can use as a reference in future
* Involve the client manager throughout the project lifecycle to help them gain an understanding of what's involved

If you have any problems with the project specifications, raise it with the relevant people early and in a professional manner, and try to suggest solutions. A really great specification should allow you and your team to under sell and over deliver.

#### Adequate Time

Aside from how long the project itself will take is how long it will take you to manage it. Unfortunately, this is almost impossible to estimate and only gets easier with experience. Ideally you'll only be managing one project at a time but it may be the case that you have to handle multiple projects. This may be achieveable as long as your multiple projects are all staggered at different phases. Don't start more than one project at the same time.

Most importantly, if at any stage you feel you don't have enough time to adequately manage your workload, raise it immediately. You are at risk of losing control of the project, which will only serve to increase your workload and stress levels, and you will inevitably take the brunt of the blame if the project fails to be a success.

As with web designers and developers, if we have enough time to do our jobs properly web project managers feel more confident of delivering high quality projects and that’s what makes us happy.

#### Trust and Confidence

As we discussed above, trust from the client, the client manager, your boss, and every member of the production team is crucial. You are on the front-lines, making critical decisions on a daily basis. The success or failure of the entire project largely falls on your shoulders and yet your job relies on so many uncontrollable factors. Good project management doesn't necessarily lead to project success, but bad project management always leads to project failure. Trust can only be gained and isn't given blindly. You gain it by demonstrating that you can do your job effectively, take control, and always, always accept responsibility.

#### Suitable Tools

You're going to have a lot on your plate so you should make use of the myriad of tools available to make your work more efficient. We're not going to recommend any specific ones here but if it's your first day on the job then you're going to want to set yourself up with some or all of the following:

* A easy to use task planner that syncs across all your devices
* A note taking tool that syncs across all your devices
* A timeline tool
* A project planner, e.g. a kanban board or gant chart
* Somewhere to store important details about each project
* A shared calendar
* A shared chatroom
* A code editor
* Whatever software you need to open design documents

Use whatever you're most comfortable with, beit a notebook and a whiteboard or one of these all-encompassing bells-and-whistles SaaS platforms of which there are many, many paid and open-source options. Having a physical kanban board is a great idea because it's easily visible and accessible to the production team, but bear in mind that most of your work will need to be easily documented and shared.

#### A Capable Production Team

In your role you simply don't have the time to do everything yourself, or even to help out with content, design, development and testing, on top of everything else. You need to be able to confidently delegate tasks and know that they will be completed to your standards of quality, and also resist the temptation to even think that something would have been done better if you'd just done it yourself. Relying on the skills of your team is essential and so that means not just hiring well but also maintaining and developing skills - the better your team gets the easier your job becomes and the better your products are.

You should absolutely be involved in the hiring process. If you're not, start kicking and screaming until you are. Nobody knows better than you what skillsets your team may be lacking and what are in surplus, nor is anyone else in a better position to assess how well a candidate will fit into your team. Chances are you've done design or development work previously so you can accurately assess candidates' breadth and depth of knowledge. You can find more useful advice about hiring & firing in _Chapter 3 - Production Directors_. Remember though, as we talked about previously, not to be resource greedy. Perhaps you don't need to hire someone new if an existing team member can be trained up.

Each web project is different so you'll need to establish early on which skillsets you'll require to pull it off and match that up with what you have available in order to identify any potential gaps. Maybe you're a freelancer or a small agency where you yourself cover many roles. At the very least specialist jobs require specialist skills and may require dedicated experts, i.e. content people, design people, development people, testing people etc., to handle them. Within in each specialist area may be more precise specialisations to consider. A design role may need to cover complex animation, image manipulation, or video production for instance. A development role may necessitate experience with particular languages or frameworks. Your project will have a much greater chance of success of you have the luxury of putting together the right team.

> Developers often treat PM as The Source of All Evil. And to some point they’re right. It’s a project manager who brings more work. It’s a project manager who bugs everyone asking when they’re going to be done.

> _- Pawel Brodzinski_

You have to expect a lot of support from your team, but that means you have to provide it as well. An atmosphere of mutual support is what you're going for here - if you scratch their backs they'll scratch yours. The support you provide may come in many forms. After you delegate tasks, always make yourself available to answer questions and provide encouragement. Never just dump a load of work on someone and disappear. Sometimes, get them started yourself if you can. A few lines of code, some basic wireframes, or some lines of copy may go a long way to show humility, that you're not above the work of others. In doing so you're setting an example and might even learn something if they can provide feedback on your work, leading to a better mutual understanding. As with clients or directors who like to micromanage, my advise is to leave it to the experts and those whose role is there specifically for completing such tasks. You need to respect and actively seek their skills, knowledge, and advice.
 
Thank them and recognise their efforts publicly, but always offer your own criticism and advice privately. Even if they are performing well, it's your job to push them to always be better. Constantly encourage them to learn new tools and techniques, give them the time for training to practice what they've learned. Of course, you need to take this into account when formulating schedules and conjuring deadlines. It will pay off in the long run as they learn to work more efficiently and can accommodate a greater variety of requests. That means fewer bottlenecks for you.

Ultimately, no matter whether you always manage to hire industry wizards or not, your team will only ever be as productive as you enable them to be, which leads us nicely onto the next section.

## Facilitating Others

Your role basically covers the following:

* requirements analysis
* scheduling
* budgeting
* task delegation
* monitoring & reviews
* documentation
* training

Let's pigeonhole your production team into content managers, designers, developers, and testers. They are all highly skilled experts with very specific remits. You need to keep them focused on what they are there do, which is hopefully also what they do best and what they enjoy most. Nothing will destroy their passion, productivity, and morale quicker than having them involved in other parts of the project beyond those remits. For example, asking a developer to do content population, or asking a designer to write headlines, or indeed asking anyone to fill out timesheets...

### Keeping them focused

Of course there are times when everyone is going to have to do minor tasks in support of project management. Yes, timesheets, but also planning meetings, their own internal schedules, answering phone calls and emails etc. You have to do everything you can to minimise the impact of such tasks so that they don't cause people to get sidetracked such that quality is reduced and the project momentum is dampened. Even if just one person is suffering more than others under the weight of unread emails, the effectiveness of the entire team is affected.

So, how can you help? Be a stress sponge. Back to the e-mail example, ensure you are copied in on all project-related e-mails. Yep, all of them. That way you have an eye on to whom issues are being directed and can step in if needs be. By reducing their stress, they work better, which means that eventually you have less to be stressed about. So the stress dividends pay off later.

> It should be assumed that part of the role is to basically take crap on behalf of your team in such a way that they don’t even get a whiff of it, even if they’re the cause of it. Your job is to keep your team positive, motivated and focussed on their job – and if this means taking some crap you know you don’t deserve then so be it.

> _- Sam Barnes_

You also need to shield your team from information that they personally don't need to worry about. In the same way, your boss isn't troubling you with the organisation's overall financial situation, the office space rent, employee health cover, taxes etc. Anything client-related, for instance, can stay between you and the client manager. Anything code-related can filter down to the developer. Sam Barnes' 'crap' analogy is actually an excellent one. He goes on to note that if you can't take the crap then you have no place in any management role. So when e-mails come your way containing issues that you may need to seek help on, first try to identify the core problem or question - you may need to translate or simplify the message to make it easier for the recipient. Never just forward emails or specifications. This is expecially true of bug reports - chances are the client's language will appear commical at best to any developer, and confusing at worst. If you can identify the bug yourself, write the report more accurately and concisely, and go on to provide accomanying screenshots, then your developer will be able to dive right in. Better yet, if you can identify the cause of the bug yourself then you not only help them out considerably but you may also learn something new or maintain your own skills.

Never mislabel an issue as urgent unless it really, really is. Again, you should try and absorb the stress as much as possible. If something can possibly wait, and the chances are it probably can, then let it wait until the end of an interation or sprint or at least a suitable gap in the work. If something really is urgent, then do everything you can to reduce its impact - put more people on it or try and step in to help with it yourself. Especially don't label something as urgent just because it will help with your own scheduling - that's transferring your stress onto others.

Consider when it's appropriate to disturb people. Get to know your team, when they are most productive and when they might be able to handle short interruptions. Limit scheduling meetings to the start of the day and never drag someone into a meeting where they are not required for the entire duration. Arranging group meetings, such as daily standups, can be a great way for every to quickly provide everyone else with an update on their status. If in part of a meeting you find there are one or two small things you need someone for, take a note and get back to whoever's asking once you have the answer later. Again, if it's something small then wait until that person is on a break or clearly available to talk.

Lastly, if it looks like someone is approaching burnout or is doing too much overtime, give them a break. Even in the face of looming deadlines and everyone is under pressure, it's better that you take the flak yourself from your client or boss. Tired and stressed team members do not produce their best work, which will in the end be detrimental to the product. Reaching actual burnout will just mean a longer recovery time before they can be productive again, further impacting the project. As Sam Barnes said, you just have to take the crap yourself.

### Be a team player

Put yourself on the same level, and never consider yourself in charge or in any way perched on a pedestal somewhere above the other team members.

Be humble, and willing to forgo the glory and recognition for your efforts. Jony Ive may get the credit for Apple's impeccable product design, but he has a team of 80,000 people working behind the scenes at California all focused on making Apple products the best they can be and marketing them to the masses. Let the star designers and developers have their glory, let praise be adorned over the beauty and the functionality, but remain smug in the knowledge that if you weren't there everything would completely fall apart. If you have a team of 10 people, then feel those 10 pats on your back. 

Stand up for your team members. Be willing to push back on clients, your boss, or other teams if more time is needed or if requests simply can't be met. And always defend them to your bosses, even if they have made mistakes; never blame them for anything. Any mistakes or failures are always those of the team and it's your job to find a mitigating solution.

### Give them what they need

Exactly what they need. Nothing more, nothing less. At the start of each project spend as much time as you need pouring through the specs and requirements, filtering, summarising, and categorising:

#### Content Managers

* What is or should be the tone of the organisation? What should their voice sound like if they were a person? What is their industry and who are their competitors?
* Who will be providing the copy? Us? Them? Who will be maintaining it going forward and what tools might they need to do so?
* What is the content breakdown? Blog posts? Product listings? etc. Are there any potential rich data models?
* What is the rough scale of the content? How many posts or product listings? etc.
* Who is the target demographic?
* How/when/where will the content be consumed? What is the nature of the web project?
* What languages will be supported?
* What are the accessibility requirements?
* What are the target keywords?
* What format should copy be supplied in?
* Is a CMS required? What content types should be static and which dynamic?

#### Designers

* What is the theme of the organisation? Brand colours, typefaces, brand style guide etc.
* Who is the target demographic?
* What are the supported platforms for the web project? What are the performance considerations?
* What are the client's personal style preferences?
* What is the tone of the content being presented?
* Who will provide imagery or what are the guidelines around imagery?

#### Developers

* What are the supported platforms and devices?
* What is the required functionality?
* What is the performance budget?
* Is a content management system required? How much dynamic content will there be?
* Will any data be drawn from external sources?

#### Testers

* What are the supported platforms for the web project?
* What is the performance budget?
* What is the UI style guide?

#### Everyone

* What are the deadlines?!?

You'll note that of the requirements listed above, the content managers will need the most up-front, because their work will be the bulk of the beginning phase of the project. Content first, remember. Following that is the designers' requirements, followed by the developers' and testers'. That is because design is to some extent dependent on content, and development is similarly dependent on design, while testing is of course dependent on everything. That is not to say though that they are not all interdependent, nor that they should be executed independently in a waterfall model, but we'll get to that later.

What we've covered so far in this section is by no means exhaustive and indeed every team or web professional may have their own individual requirements. What's important is that you take the information you have, identify and investigate any gaps, and tease out specifically what you need to share with who. Even after you've reviewed the details of a new project yourself, approach each team member or team lead individually and find out what else they might need. There will be items on which you will need their feedback in order to formulate your budgets and schedules. Only once everyone has all the required information at hand, or at least as much as can possibly be provided, are you ready to kick off and deliver your plan.

### Adaptive communication

You need to be able to communicate with everyone involved in the project **on their level**. Perhaps your hands-on experience will equip you with the ability to talk details with designers or developers, but you need to be able to speak a different language when taking the same conversation to someone else, like a client for instance. Not just your use of jargon, you'll also need to carefully consider your overall approach, your language, your tone.

Designers and developers especially might be quite territorial and defensive of their work and so any comments, feedback, or requests must be framed delicately so that you convey trust in their skills and abilities. If you say anything, even accidentally, that makes them feel belittled or reduced to the status of pixel pusher or code monkey then motivation is instantly crushed and the project will suffer. This takes practice and it pays off to be open about your approach to conversation, especially with people you haven't worked with much before, by asking directly if what you're saying seems totally reasonable and always asking if they have their own comments or suggestions.

While with designers you might want to use inspecific language, allowing their creativity to flourish, developers will want logical and straightforward speak. Similarly, while you can jest with the designers about certain “comic” typefaces, or with developers about the web browsers that always give them problems (you know the ones I'm talking about!), your clients, client managers, and bosses on the other hand are not interested in the implementation details, no matter how proud you are of them, and just want to hear about decisions, progress, results, and impact. Remember that no personality trait is negative in all circumstances, save say predilection to constant outrage, and as part of your role as the linchpin holding the team together you must be able to adapt to and bring together each individual.

### Resolving Conflicts

You are inevitably going to annoy people as a project manager. You have to balance budgets, timelines, and constantly make decisions that will always leave some people less than satisfied. You can't please everyone all the time. For example, in such a fast-paced industry new tools, technologies, and techniques are emerging every day and designers or developers probably often suggest jumping on one bandwagon or another. If you disagree with them then they're going to get annoyed (in this situation you might want to suggest a suitable side-project?). Just as inevitably, others are going to annoy you, and each other. It's simply the nature of working in a busy team. The best you can expect as a project manager is to earn reputation points and respect for getting the job done well. Reputation, however, is a fragile thing.

We've already covered the importance of empathy and honesty, the understanding of people's motives and perspectives when making decisions. The best way to pre-emptively avoid conflicts in a team is to prepare in advance and consider what would make each team member happy and what would annoy them; how can you make them happy and what can you do when they're likely to be annoyed?

Your boss or agency director wants revenue, a well-managed cash-flow, and happy clients that will refer more business. For this they need the project completed on time, on budget, and to a level of quality they personally deem satisfactory. You need to make a solid plan, stay on top of things, and identify and work towards meeting or exceeding that particular level of quality. Clients want a project that's future proof, easy enough to maintain, and facilitates their organisation's goals. It just has to look great and work perfectly. Designers want to push the boundaries, make something that stands out, something that they can be proud to show off. Developers want to play with the latest technologies and implement efficient, cutting edge solutions. You hopefully want all of the above and other project managers that you may work with just want your projects to be on schedule so as not to impact theirs. Keep in mind that you're very unlikely to be able to keep everyone happy all the time but that ultimately everyone wants want they think is best for the project so you can focus on that shared goal.

Let's take a common example of a difficult decision you might face that has the potential for causing conflict: the developer suggesting a new technology. First consider why they are suggesting it. Does it bring potential performance benefits? Will it improve efficiency, allowing for less repetition in future projects? Or maybe they just want to play around with it and learn about it on the company's dime. You need to have the aptitude and willingness to research that technology quickly and assess its potential risks and benefits in the context of the project, the client's aims, and your organisational workflow. Being ultimately responsible for the project, you'll need a full understanding before you can make a decision, and you'll need to have absolute trust in the developers' ability to make good use of the technology. Whatever you decide, you'll need to communicate clearly and justify your decision to everyone.

If you choose to go with it, you should highlight the potential benefits to your boss and the project owner, with the caveat of the added risk to project timelines. They may try to overrule your decision, in which case you'll have to convince them. If you reject the developer's suggestion then you'll need to give them more than just a “no”. Perhaps you've determined that the new technology risks and already fragile client relationship, or that the risks outweigh the benefits compared to your current stable solutions. Maybe the new technology is not mature or battle-tested enough. Perhaps there are browser or platform considerations or not enough budget to risk overruns. There are plenty of reasons, and after explaining them the chances are your developers are still going to be unhappy. You might be labelled as the PM with your head stuck in the sand, holding the company back. But have conviction in your decisions. While the developer is wholly focused on the technical solutions, you're the only one with a complete overview of the project and it's you who are ultimately responsible for it. Hopefully regularly communicating this to the team will raise their awareness and make them more considerate of the business, not just technical, decisions.

What about your boss when you go over budget? You will be burdened with the assumption that the project has been badly managed. When this is the case, and you know it's the case, simply admit it, learn from it, and take those learnings to the next project. We can but learn from our mistakes. On occasion though you might want to deliberately make decisions that will cause the project to go overbudget or some other such dicision that will displease your boss. For example you might have a team member focused on training, you might be experimenting with new project management processes, you might be supporting a side a project that benefits the agency, or you might be doing extra work to please an important client. If you've analysed the situation and you are in the position of making such a decision then you should communicate it to your boss before announcing it to the team. If you can mitigate upsetting news with something that adds value or provides return on investment then you should get approval and respect for your decision.

Say a client wants to add a new feature that's out of scope. I know, this **never** happens, right? You can't just say “no” and damage the client relationship, but then you can't screw up all your budgets and timelines and resource allocations by outright agreeing to it. Consider for a moment that perhaps the client has additional budget available or may be willing to extend the project's timeline? Are any parts of the project running ahead of schedule or under budget? Maybe you might be able to accommodate the new request? The client may be willing to sacrifice another feature for this one, or maybe there's a quick and easy way to implement a similar feature that could be upgraded later. There's also a chance that building this feature might benefit your team or agency, giving them new skills or a new offering to sell to other clients. Only ever say “no” to a client when there's absolutely nothing in the universe that can be done. The client probably isn't just being cheeky, trying to squeeze as much out of your agency as possible, nor frivolously expecting your team's work on new features to be easy. The request probably comes from a reaction to something in their industry that they understand better than you. There is probably a good reason why they're asking for it so even if you have to reject the request, understanding the reasoning behind it and offering a good alternative will reduce the chance of conflict. As at the start of the project, talk the client through this new feature, the business reason, and the expected KPI. As always, assess the situation thoroughly and then make your decision. If you agree, you'll have a happy client. If you reject, then, as with the developer, as with your boss, take them through the decision process step by step; explain the risks, explain the situation, and discuss the alternatives. The more transparent you are, the more understanding the client will be.

There are of course many other situations where you will face being the cause of conflict but these three examples demonstrate a common theme. Analyse the situation, make a decision, communicate the decision, and find a solution. Easy right? 

What about situations when you're not the cause of the conflict, such as conflicts within the team or between teams? Digital families can be fairly disfunctional. You're no doubt aware of the age-old (well, say 20 year old) conflict between web designers and developers, like squabbling children. And you're surely all too aware that the children complain about their parents - the project managers...

The underlying cause of these conflicts is clashing priorities, arrogance, incompetence, and lack of awareness. Unfortunately, you're always going to have to deal with these in your role as a web project manager.

Dealing with each team member and having an overall view of the project, you're in the best position to deal with these problems. We've already talked briefly about the different priorities of each role. By having an understanding of these priorities and being able to empathise, you have to find a way to champion the notion that everyone is working toward the same goal - project success - and that nobody is deliberately trying to screw anyone else over so that all team members are more willing to compromise.

Arrogance is something we've all encountered in this industry, and probably something we've all been guilty of once or twice. It's natural for highly skilled experts to have confidence in their skills and knowledge and react defensively when challenged. They dig their heels and seem to want to deliberately obstruct the progress of a web project until they get their way. All you can do here is try to remove barriers. If someone is seemingly being difficult, recognise that it's probably just pride in the work and find a way to turn that to something positive. Take them aside for a private conversation and listen to their concerns, make them realise that their concerns are at least being acknowledged. Make sure you understand their reasoning and then respectfully explain how you need to move things forward. Perhaps explain with a personal annecdote or offer an example of similar issues another person or team is facing. Help them to appreciate that it's not just them facing this situation, give them an overall picture of the project and how this issue is impacting it, then end the conversation with a deal aimed at removing the barrier.

Incompetence is an easily thrown accusation, particularly between designers and developers. A designer might blame a developer for not fully implementing their original vision, or a developer might get irritated with a designer for handing off disorganised and unrealistic mockups with overly complicated layouts. These situations arise, of course, due to lack of communication and short timelines, but also sometimes it's due to genuine incompetence and that's where you have to step in to address it. Sometimes, for whatever reason, people just don't do their work properly. You could allow the slagging match to continue, you might even be tempted to take sides, but that's obviously only going to exacerbate the situation. Instead we need to find a positive way to solve the problem. You'll be the mediator, resetting the tone of the conversation and having all parties involved in a clear, informal, and open discussion about how to resolve the problem. Can we simplify the layout? Can we allow more time for development and testing? How do we avoid this problem in the future? You'll hopefully notice how surprisingly easy it is to turn the tone from a spiteful one to a positive and constructive one, allowing for mutual empathy.

Another common cause for internal squabbling is when the team members aren't given a clear overall picture of the project, along with its business goals and limitations. A good developer will want full feature testing, accessibility testing, security testing, user testing, the works. But in many cases there just may not be the time or the budget. Skipping such steps, that they deem important, without explaining to them the reasons conveys the message that you don't care about quality or standards, and they will find your decisions loathesome. It's simply not the case that your team can't understand or isn't interested in the business decisions. They too may be on career paths that will someday put them in the position of making the difficult decisions that now burden you. If you can find a way to communicate the business decisions to them then you'll make them care about the business decisions as much as you do and will appreciate that sometimes they will have to put together dirty hacks. Hopefully you'll be able to learn from those times and allow more time and budget for standards compliance in future projects.

Finally, no matter what the cause of the conflict is, try and resolve it yourself first. You should never feel the need to escalate the issue to your boss or manager. This will only add to their stress and decrease your value to them, as well as setting a poor example to your production team, whom you should keep leading and motivating. Education in skills, business, increased knowledge, and heightened awareness are your tools here. As we've talked about many in times in this chapter already, it begins with empathy - understanding the problem from all sides, listening to any and all grievances, and then finding common ground to keep the project moving forward before conflicts turn nasty and become irreprably damaging to the current project and to future ones.

## Make a Plan

So far in this chapter we've mostly covered what it takes to be a successful web project manager, or indeed any manager, the personality traits and the social challenges. This is all arguably the most important aspect of a successful project - you don't need to have the best team with the best skills but if you have a great team that work really well together then you're sure to produce successful work.

Now though let's get into the fun stuff - the actual tasks your individual role covers and how to best perform them. Here is where it starts - planning. Meticulous, hair-raising, sweat-inducing planning.

The web is as littered with articles about project management planning as library shelves are stuffed with books on the topic. Each one stuffed with corporate jargon and calling for specific methodologies that must be strictly followed lest the world cave in on you. They make different assumptions about how much time you have or what sort of team you're working with. The realty is that every project and every team is different. A PMP qualification isn't necessarily going to get you anywhere. There are no hard and fast rules and so we shalln't be covering such rules here. Instead we'll try to be more general, talking about things you need to think about when devising your own system.

Web project managers should get into the habit of thorough and consistent planning so as to make it a repeatable and reliable process for every project. Skills learned in doing so are entirely transferrable to other roles too. Thorough planning is especially important for freelancers and smaller agencies, where there is less room for error as mistakes could have a bigger impact on the overall business. The industry is moving quickly and is reaching a level of maturity that necessitates professional management processes to ensure quality that stands-out among ever-increasing competition. Clients are becoming more web savvy and capable of judging the professionalism, competence, and consistency of a production team.

Why do we even bother planning? We have a team of experts to hand. Sit a designer down in front of a blank canvas with some content, and a developer with a code editor, a functional spec. and a styleguide, give them a few weeks and all we be good right? Project planning, or the lack of it, can lead to extremely different results. By planning well we're able to clearly define and manage the project scope, identify and minise risks, and break the allocated time into manageable chunks and tasks. We can determine reaslistic milestones, track progress, maintain control, and secure resources.

This all sounds totally obvious to you now, right? But as you're surely aware, detailed and effective planning that covers all of these bases is not always done, for varying reasons.

As much as you want to create and maintain a great plan, you may simply not have time. A good plan may take more than a day. It may take a week, or more. Massive projects demand massive planning. Perhaps you're juggling multiple projects at the same time and you can't devote all your time every day to this master plan. It will seem like your planning time is stalling everything else; your content person or designer might be idly waiting. More time = more cost. Ideally, you might argue that a good plan always saves time and money in the long run, but depending on the project this might not always be the case. You may need to break down the planning itself into smaller, more manageable chunks, just enough to give you a detailed and immediate overview of the tasks at hand. Unfortunately, effective planning does demand your full attention. If you're going to be handling other projects then you'll need to allocate time in the plans for those projects so that you have time to plan this one. Try and isolate yourself from meetings and emails and phone calls, for at least a day, so that you can sit down and deep dive into this particular project. Consider it the same as taking a sick day, which is beyond your control, and may also impact other projects. You always manage to catch up afterwards and the situation you'll be in afterwards, equipped with a good plan, is akin to being well-rested and raring to go.

As the old saying goes, time is money. When quoting the cost for a new project you may have to put in more effort justifying the time needed for planning because it doesn't directly produce deliverables that the client or projects owner values. They want a website or app, not a 50 page PDF document; the plan is for your team's internal use, so why should they be paying for it? Project management likely takes between 10-20% of the total time that it takes to put the project together, much of it planning. You'll need to ensure that budget is available for this before starting. Lack of budget is no excuse for lack of planning. If no budget is available for planning, then you'll probably have to recouperate it from design or development time.

Maybe you're a small agency or solitary freelancer and your project scopes and budgets are so small and simple that you don't deem planning necessary. But the more you do it the quicker and easier it will become. For smaller projects it's even easier because you have less to focus on. And focus is the key - a good plan that you can share with all stakeholders not only looks professional but keeps everyone focused on the goals and what they need to do to achieve them.

Not everyone can put together good plans. Effective planning is an acquired skill. Being at the point of starting any plan is a daunting feeling no matter how experienced you are or how many books and articles you've read. Experience is always the most valuable commodity when refining any skill. Lack of it, however, is never an excuse to dismiss planning as a waste of time or not worth the effort. You may still manage to keep your boss and your clients happy with the work you deliver despite not putting together detailed plans; you'll still get paid. It's like cooking. You could buy a packet that you just add to the pan and heat up or you could buy all the ingredients and make the dish from scratch. You've been told making it from scratch will yield much better results. You may even believe this. But it's a lot of extra effort, probably costs more, and will only yield better results than the convenient packet if you know what you're doing and have cooking experience. Eventually though, after you've cooked the dish many times, you will be able to put it together quickly, easily, and will enjoy it much more. If you invite people to try it, they will notice the difference between the packet and the home-cooked version, and they will be impressed with your efforts.

Sometimes, a plan just fails entirely. Nothing goes as planned and you end up pulling your hair out. This can only put down to bad planning so you'll have to adjust your planning techniques. Other times planning might actually just over-complicate things. Plans that are long, boring, filled with waffle or unnecessary detail may be ignored or not fully absorbed. Overly detailed plans that demand updating GANTT charts every few hours or wireframing nearly empty whole pages may be unrealstic to stick to at best, or at worst just a waste of time. Sometimes you just need to get stuck in and start doing rather than just planning. You have to assess for each project the level of detail required and the when you should update the schedule to perform crucial tasks. Remember that the goal is to maintain control over the project, so you'll need to be flexible enough to know when to plan and when to do.

Another reason why planning is often lacklustre or skipped entirely is the sad fact that planning isn't always fun. Some people like it, while others hate it. Sometimes you might just not be in the mood. If you really don't feel like it then there's no really good advice other than to try and change the way you plan to make it more enjoyable and rewarding. If you come out on the other side of a project knowing that your plan helped and made your life easier, if everything “went to plan”, then you'll surely be rewarded with the smug feeling of success. If you really can't find a way to make planning enjoyable, even tolerable, then sorry... it's just something you're going to have to do. You might want to try hacking your brain to associate it with something positive, some other reward? On days you allocate to planning, ignore all your emails, cancel your meetings, setup an isolated room, make it comfy, and play your favourite music, and get your favourite snacks. Soon you'll start looking forward to planning days.

If you've worked with other managers before, you'll be aware that there are different kinds of planning personalities. There are those who don't enjoy detailed planning and dive straight into production. They are up and running quickly and solve problems in an ad-hoc fashion, as and when they arise. On the other hand there are those who start slowly, meticulously planning every step along the way, slowly gaining momentum, ensuring every task is completed successfully before moving on. The hare and the tortoise, so to speak.

To a large degree, your success with either approach will depend on your personality and on your team. The hard, fast, slap-dash approach may seem crazy but people do manage to pull it off, producing a successful project on time, on budget, and to a high standard of quality. If you can motivate a higly skilled team and confidently make snap decisions then why not? Maybe someone who spends all their time putting out fires inherently has a greater sense of purpose? Maybe being so obviously busy acts to motivate the team? Maybe they just feed on the adrenaline? More likely they're just extremely busy people facing the weighty pressures of cash flow, unrealistic and inflexible deadlines, project overload, lack of project management skills and experience, or all of the above.

A safer approach may be to try and prevent fires _before_ they start. It may be less glamourous but also less damaging. Someone who takes this more measured approach is probably has more time and fewer projects on thier hands, is more experienced, has a fear of emergencies and unnecessary risk. Maybe they even enjoy meticulous planning and have had success with it before.

Which approach is better is largely irrelevant as it's beyond your control. You can't change your personality. Likewise, especially in smaller teams or agencies, you are just going to have to skip all or most of the all-important planning phase due to time constraints and suchlike. You know it's bad but you don't have an option. You can only take comfort in knowing that the more blazes you have to battle, the better you will be come at reducing them to smouldering embers. You may be able to rely on having a placid client or a stellar team and that will go a long way towards helping you produce a great end result. But the minute something goes wrong and you lose control, you're going to struggle reigning the project in when you have poor documentation, ambiguous or non-existent scope definition, and unclear sign-offs. The more organised, detailed planning approach at least offers you more consistency. You'll become accustomed to what kind of problems occur at what stages and you'll be better prepared to comprehensively deal with them. Without a detailed plan you also have no recourse when facing angry clients. Armed with a plan, you can clearly point out the how, when, who, what, and why when things inevitably go wrong, allowing the client to understand and accept the situation. Essentially, there's no guaranteed way to project success. There will always be unforseen problems which you may be able to pre-empt or prepare for, or may not. What you can guarantee is that the probability of success is much higher, and the risk much lower, when you have a plan and you stick to it. That ought to keep everyone focused.

### Key Performance Indicators

Earlier we talked about the KPIs for your role and the benefit being that you remain focused on what's important to be successful and your decisions can be guided by clear objectives. Similarly when it comes to planning a project you need to determine what are its measures of success. What should your production team stay focused on at all times throughout the project lifecycle. These project-specific KPIs should be documented at the top of your plan before project kickoff and shared among all project stakeholders, which of course includes your team. 

In fact, these KPIs should be listed on all project documentation, including not just your plan but also on specifications, creative briefs, sitemaps, even somewhere in the source code comments. They should be verbally reiterated in meetings at the start of each project phase, and also when dicussing any new feature or change requests. All assigned tasks should be framed in the context of KPIs. Why are we bulding this feature? To achieve target X. Why do we have to remove that section? Because it doesn't meet condition X.

The client manager's original proposal, or sometimes even documentation from the client, should detail the business goals and/or KPIs. In your role you have to analyse and challenge these where necessary to ensure they are realistic, measurable, and provide sufficient context. For the most part, the KPIs listed in your plan will be the same. Where they explicitly impact production, for instance when making demands on performance, technologies, platforms and so on, those KPIs should be expanded and explained in more detail where possible to provide clarity for your team.

KPIs have to be carefully considered. As an example, imagine you're asked to increase website traffic by 10%. You record the average traffic on the current website over a fixed length period. Post-launch, you monitor the traffic for the same length of time. Compare the two and you should know what percentage improvement you've achieved, right? But what if the client had run a marketing campaign while you were gathering pre-launch metrics and it had skewed the data? Or if a new competitor launches around the same time, impacting a fair comparison of post-launch metrics? There are many business factors that should be taken into consideration when formulating KPIs. With a little research you should increase the chance of being able to produce equally rated comparative metrics.

KPIs are surprisingly easy to forumulate for the enormous potential benefits they offer. Furthermore they cover not just the tools and technologies but also the business goals. That means that achieving business goals brings business value. Finally they also provide a boundary for client requests. When the client requests something that's out of scope, you or your client manager can go back and ask which KPI the request serves. If not related to any of the established and agreed KPIs, the client will hopefully withdraw the request, meaning you've kept **them** focused on **their** business goals, saved them money, and preserved the project's scope and timeline.

One important set of KPIs for all web projects is the **performance budget**. Performance is crucial for the success of every modern web project and dependent on so many factors that it needs to be at the forefront of everyone's minds throughout production. Performance isn't just about code either - it starts with content and information architectire and design. Not only are increasing numbers of global users on low-bandwidth or low-powered devices, or in areas with slower connections, but they are increasingly accustomed to using blazingly fast sites and apps like Google which, whether strictly fair or not, set their expectations. Things that affect performance might be:

* Total initial download for new users
* Total initial download for return users
* Total number of HTTP requests (if using HTTP1.*)
* Initial load time on X bandwidth
* Return load time on X bandwidth
* A minimum score of X on Google Pagespeed Insights
* Wcag 2.0 compliance
* Memory usage

These performance KPIs highlight the benefits of KPIs being useful for decision making. During production if you test against your KPI metric while adding a new feature and fail, you have 3 easy options:

* Optimise an existing feature or asset
* Remove an existing feature or asset
* Don’t add the new feature or asset

They will ultimately depend on implementation details - what technology you're using to produce the website or app - and also target audience - what technology the users are using to access the website or app - but you should determine early what goals you should estabish for which of these (or other?) variables. Whatever goals you decide on, you need to be able to gather accurate before and after metrics. You also need to be confident that you stick to your targets. For instance, you might find out later that restricting yourself to your 250KB total payload goal turns out to be a real struggle. Rather than letting yourself off or adjusting the KPI, effectively moving the goal posts, you'll have to perhaps forgo certain features that might require 3rd-party libraries. In this case you should revisit this particular KPI and ask yourself why the goal was set at 250KB in the first place.

### Setting Scope, Identifying Risks, and Assigning Tasks

To establish scope, you need to speak at length with the client or client manager, break the project down into specific feature requirements, going into as much detail as possible. Set some time aside and talk for as long as it takes, documenting everything. If the conversation leaves any gaps in the required information, then document the assumptions you need to make; these could be placeholders that you could ellaborate on later.

Your objective here is to get a list of required content, specific feature requirements (i.e. functionality), along with any other general requirements (e.g. design theme). From there you can break those down into individual tasks. You should try to be as granular as is reasonable - the smaller the task the more manageable it is. You can then assess what resources will be required for each task and for how long, being sure to be generous with your estimates. By summing up the total time and resources required you can compare with the available time and budget. If you go over the limit on one or both of these, then another meeting is required in which you need to agree to either extend the budget or deadline, or somehow reduce or simplify the feature set. This is why planning takes time - several rounds of requirements gathering, analysis, and revisions.

And the end of this process you should have a detailed albeit high-level plan which you can input into your task tracking system that outlines all of the required features, who will be working on them, and how long they should take. You are now in a position to guard against scope screep because you can check any feature requests against the list you have. You have identified potential risks and bottlenecks by determining which tasks will take longest and which depend on others. You have an agreed deadline before which you are confident all tasks can be completed. You're ready to plan the project schedule. You are in control.

### Roles & Responsibilities

Part of your project plan is going to be the assignment of tasks to people. That means all project stakeholders: the project owner, your boss, the client manager, all of your production team, and of course yourself. This is to make everyone clear about what they need to do in order to make the project a success. It's one of the easiest parts of project planning because roles generally don't change much from project to project as people's skillsets and focus remains the same or at least tends to change slowly.

For example your production director should be aware that you may require additional resources to complete the project, even if only temporary. That means hiring new team members or perhaps re-arranging other projects to free up people. They may also need to step in and defend the team's decisions to the client, or to help with negotiating budgets by adding weight to the conversation. A client manager must be aware of the timings, costs, and feedback requirements. Roles for the production team are generally obvious but should still be stated clearly. Whether you want to explicitly name people in your plan is up to you, but you may find it helpful to make people feel more personally invested in the project and also to reassure the client that you have a team of real hardworking people dedicated to their project and justifying their budget.

The role that generally needs the most reminding of their responsibilites is the client or project owner. This is because they, unlike you and your team, presumably don't do this for a living day-in, day-out. Maybe it's their first time taking part in the production of a web project or maybe it's just something they don't really delve into. They may be under the assumption that if they're paying you then they don't have to do anything - you don't go to a restaurant to cook your own food do you? Well... in some restaurants you do. 

It's important to highlight to them that they are deeply involved in the process. They're investing in the project so you want to be sure that you're delivering exactly what they want. Feedback loops, and the quality of the feedback, has a huge impact on the progress of the project and its final outcome, respectively. You may need them to provide not just feedback but also content or other assets on which your team's work depends.

Assessing how much time to allocate to client tasks can be tricky at the best of times so you should consult them regularly to determine when would be best to schedule feedback loops based on when they are available. By stating clearly to them their role in the project they will be made aware of how they could negatively impact (their own?) deadline. Depending on your relationship with them you might even want to put it explicitly in writing that any delays on their end will push back the final deadline by the same length of time. It's about setting their expectations early, even before you've properly started work on the project.

Some project owners will of course just want to leave you to it and wait for the finished product. Ideally though, the more you involve the project owner in the production process, the more personally invested they will feel, and thus more motivated to continue maintaining and improving the product. That's the goal here - the ongoing success of the product.

### Timing

Now that you have a clear list of resource-allocated feature-based tasks you can start to plan who should do what when. Aside from those tasks, you'll also need to plan for client tasks, changes and revisions, dependencies, lag times, resource availability, and milestones. This may just sound like jargon, but they are things that inevitably act as hurdles in every single project.

#### Client Tasks

Outlining the client's responsibilities explicitly here in the project schedule highlights to them what they need to do and when they need to do it by. They are probably busy people too, or might be working on a different schedule or in a timezone to you and your team. You need to make them aware in advance when they will be needed to provide content or media or feedback and how they might impact deadlines if they are late.

#### Changes & Revisions

For each milestone (more on milestones later), you'll want to plan for some time for reflection where both the client's team and yours can go through the features delivered so far and assess whether anything might need to be changed. Like you did with the initial feature requests for the project, these change requests will be broken down into specific tasks. If you have enough time to complete these tasks now, great, but if not you'll need to establish their urgency and maybe move things around in the schedule before pushing the project forward.

#### Dependencies

These are generally fairly easy to spot. Task B cannot be started until Task A is complete. For example, a design style guide for form input elements must be completed and signed off before part of a page with a form can be designed. Design for a hero section on the homepage cannot begin until content has been prepared for that section. CMS integration cannot be completed until the front-end templates are complete (and fully tested!). And so on. Marking dependencies clearly in the schedule higlights to everybody how their work impacts that of others. Everyone's tasks are clearly illustrated on the timeline; this is particularly useful to clients and project owners who may otherwise be under the assumption that they can sit back and let your team get on with it. This way they can quickly understand what is required of them as well. Another handy feature of maintaining timeline dependencies is that you can immediately see how far back milestones and deadlines will be shifted when there are unexpected delays. When deadlines do need to be shifted, you're going to have an angry client unless you can clearly communicate the reasons. The dependency timeline will make communicating them much easier, and the new deadlines more acceptable (especially if the client can see that it was their missed delivery that caused the delay!).

Dependency timelines naturally start to look like a waterfall, with tasks flowing from the top left - the initial tasks - to the bottom right - those at the end of the project. That is not to say however that this is a project management methodology or that everyone's work should be carried out in sequential phases, but we'll cover more on this later.

#### Lag

Lag is all the extra time it takes to complete a task or feature that you should account for in your timeline. For example, you ask a developer how long it will take to complete feature X. They tell you 4 hours and for good measure you might put down 8 hours, or 1 day, in case it actually takes them longer (such things are notoriously difficult to predict). In fact, you need to also account for a few hours of testing, maybe a day for client review and feedback, then yet more time for changes and revisions, and another feedback loop. It now seems more sensible to allocate 3 or 4 days for this task, despite the initial assumption that it could be complete in 4 hours. At first this may sound like all of your projects are going to go on forever. A great plan though will account for overlapping tasks, even if they have some level of dependency. Going back to our example, a developer could complete their task and then move onto the next one while the tester is testing or the client is reviewing. By the time the tester or client's feedback has arrived they may have completed their next task, allowing the tester or client to go on and review that while the developer makes the required changes to the original task. Smooth workflow demands that you try to consider all the variables and also the available resources, then add a big of contingency lag time.

#### Resource Planning

This is pure project management jargon - when we say resources, we mean people. You hopefully have a varied team of people that bring a different mix of skills and skill levels. Planning your project efficiently involves sharing the workload among them, ensuring that their time is optimised and that nobody is sitting around waiting for others to complete their tasks on which their own work depends. Most timeline tools will allow you to assign tasks to specific team members. This will give you an overview of who you need to work on what and when, which is very useful in teams that handle multiple project simultaneously. Maybe some team members will be unavailable or committed to other projects during certain periods so you will need to adjust your timeline to accommodate or re-assign the tasks to someone else. 

Resource planning is important not just for your projects but for your team as a whole. Ongoing problems with resource planning may indicate that your team is under or over-staffed. If you find yourself assigning more tasks to one team member than you are to others, or that one person is suffering under a larger workload, then you may be able to identify skillsets that your team may be lacking, causing certain team members to be spread too thinly. Conversely if you have a team member who is rarely assigned tasks, maybe they could be reassigned to another role or trained in some new, more useful skills?

Resource planning a huge topic in itself and there is not really any solid advice anyone can give you. The major difficulty is in guessing, for it is guesswork, how long it will take someone to complete a particular task. The reason nobody can give you any bulletproof advice is because it depends entirely on the people you're working with - everyone works at different speeds at different times - so it's just something you'll have to learn to improve as you go along. The best advice is to always try and break each task down into the smallest possible chunks that can should be completable in the shortest possible time. Short, quick task assignments are easier to manage and monitor. If there is an overrun, say if someone is struggling, then you can react quickly by assinging some help, even stepping in to help yourself, or by re-arranging your timeline to mitigate the impact on project milestones.

#### Setting Milestones

Milestones differ from deadlines in that they are internal goals, points at which your team can stop, having completed a pre-determined set of tasks or features, regroup, collect your thoughts, and review the work completed so far. Milestones are how you gauge the project progress. You might find that you need to reorganise your plan, redo some tasks, or plan for some unforseen work. Deadlines on the other hand are final cut-off dates, points at which nothing more can or should be done. Missing a deadline means that something went wrong, whereas missing a milestone just means that things aren't going quite to plan and a change needs to be made. Maybe you just didn't include enough lag time? Maybe it was beyond your control as someone fell ill? The clue is in the name - stones marking each mile of a long journey versus death - the end of everything. Milestones certainly sound a lot friendlier.

If you can complete each project phase before reaching each milestone date, then you can be sure the project is on track to be completed on time. It's up to you how often you set milestones. The project tasks may lend themselves to obvious phases, or otherwise you may just wish to set arbitrary or regular milestones just to keep everyone motivated and to maintain closer control over project progress. Alternatively, if you're confident that you can stay on top of things then you may not need to set milestones at all.

#### Accuracy vs. Guesswork - Planning Your Time

If the first part of this chapter sounded challenging, suggesting you need to be some kind of psychologist to resolve all your team members' personal issues, then you might think sitting down and drawing up a timeline will be easy. In fact, it's the hardest part of a web project manager's job. The sheer complexities of estimating and quoting timelines for web projects means you're going to do it wrong... ***a lot***. Just try a Google search for the phrase "how can I stop completing web projects on time?".

There are aspects of this role that you will enjoy, while others you don't. Few people enjoy estimating timings purely because it's such hard work and rarely proves to be entirely successful. It takes a lot of time and concentration, both of which you may not be able to spare under the weight of your existing workload. You have to predict the future. Especially if the cost for the project is based on the estimated time, then it makes you ultimately responsible for the sales success as well as the quality of the implementation, maybe even the profitability of your team or agency! If you are someone from a technical or creative background, passionate about creating and building stuff, then this is understandably going to be a joyless part of your job. Nevertheless it has to be done and you should take comfort in knowing that if you get it right, then you'll be rewarded with a warm fuzzy feeling that more than compensates.

There are so many reasons for it being difficult to plan web project timings accurately, for example:

* new untested technologies, tools, and techniques
* loosely defined scope
* imprecise specifications
* bespoke or industry-specific features
* no analysis having been done of estimated vs. actual delivery times for past projects
* client pressure to provide estimates quickly
* financial pressure to get to work and deliver quickly

And there are many other potential reasons. It's a miserable feeling indeed knowing that you've underestimated and thus committed you and your team to overtime and rushed work. And yet it's a feeling that you may get time and time again as you try and fail to formulate robust plans. Unfortunately, it all comes down to guesswork. The best you can do is sit down in advance and think about the potential risks to your timeline and try and find ways to reduce them.

Taking one of the examples from the list above, if you want to try a new technology that your team might be unfamiliar with, then you should probably spend some time researching or practicing with it first. Obviously you don't want to be doing this for free, nor does the project owner really want to be paying for it unless they get a clear cost benefit. In this case you could perhaps compromise by charging a reduced fee for a research phase that includes work on the simpler tasks. You could create a more high-level project plan based on this, to which you can add more detail once your team have had chance to use the new technology in this experimental phase and can therefore more accurately assess timings. In the best case scenario you've learned a new technology and kept the client happy with a low cost while still being productive. At worst you've still learned a new technology and made some revenue.

Luckily, at the time of writing anyway, the devil doesn't exist. The details however are ever-present. You should hopefully already know from the outset the project owner's budget. If you don't, you really need to so start pestering your client or client manager. Even a rough budget or a budget range might be enough for you to work with.

Start off by breaking the project into general, high-level, potentially overlapping, phases (i.e. task categories) and gradually get more granular and identify the distinct tasks:

* Research, Planning, Setup
* Front-End Production
* Back-End Production
* Delivery

Then you try and get more granular

* Research, Planning, Setup
    * Requirements Gathering
    * Functional Specifications
    * Content
    * Environment Setup
* Front-End Production
    * Design
    * Development
    * Testing
* Back-End Production
    * Database Setup
    * CMS Setup
    * Testing
* Delivery
    * Content Entry
    * Deployment
    * Review
    * Analysis
    * Feedback Gathering

And just keep going until you can't think of any more smaller tasks:

* Research, Planning, Setup
    * Requirements Gathering
    * Functional Specifications
        * Sitemap
        * Feature List & Wireframes

    * Deployment
    * Review
        * Post-Mortem
    * Analysis
    * Feedback Gathering

And so on - you're essentially designing the project in your head at this point. You could go on to include individual features in this list if you know them by now.

For example:

* List Feature X
    * Design
        * ... 
    * Implementation
        * Add new item
        * Delete item
        * Edit item
        * ...
    * Testing
    * ...

This is surely much better than just saying “hmm... 'List' feature... 6 hours outta do it”. Instead you're building the feature in your head and breaking it down step by step. So we need to be able to add an item to the list. How? What kind of item can we add? How can we make it easy and performant? What else might need to be considered for this seemingly simple task?

Every project will have different task requirements but following this process not only forces you to consider everything that may be required to successfully deliver this project but also makes it easier to plan and assign individual tasks and assess timings. When considering each task, you're placing yourself in the position of the person you're going to be assiging it to, thinking about what they need to do, what problems or questions they might raise, what they might need before they can start this tasks, heping you to clarify issues before work begins. Another added benefit is that it demonstrates to the project owner the scale of the work required so may also be helpful in justifying costs.

By increasing the accuracy of your timing estimates in this way, you can more easily assess the cost of the project and determine if you're likely to go over budget and need to reduce the proposed feature set, or under budget and could possibly propose more features or enhancements. The project owner probably isn't going to be happy, however, if you propose removing features in order to meet the budget. They want it all. With your nice granular list though perhaps you can find ways to shave small tasks off other features, simplifying everything, so that you still have time to deliver all the features in a more basic form that can be upgraded later. It won't take you much time to go through your list, and the client still gets their features and has full visibility on what's being sacrificed for the sake of the budget. If you're in any doubt about what can be removed or altered, then be sure to consult your client or client manager, as certain requirements may be industry specific so they should have a clearer picture of how it needs to turn out.

So in summary, now you have your granular task list for planning time, you have:

* An instant and clearly defined scope of work
* Timings you need to formulate an accurate schedule with reasonable milestones
* Clearly set project owner expectations
* Demonstrated your thoroughness and understanding to both the project owner and your team, giving everyone confidence that there are fewer chances of problems further down the line

#### Tracking Time

A plan is al very well and good but you need to be able to stick to it and the best way to do that is to plan well in the first place. Well, again, this is only going to come through experience. Not just experience doing web project management but experience working with this team on these kinds of projects. By consistently tracking how long your team actually spends on each task and measuring against how long you estimated it would take, you not only get a clearer picture of project progress but you can also determine the accuracy of your timing estimations and identify potential bottlenecks. Gradually, you will get more accurate; if you always seem to underestimate a particular task or phase then you'll know to allocate more time for those tasks on future projects.

Find a way to easily collect and collate timing data for each project. This will allow you to build up average timings for project phases so that you can give more accurate ballpark guesses and figures to your boss or client team. These guesses can also be good starting points for estimates on future projects. Equipped with a capped budget and average timings for project phases, you can find the most cost-effective solution to deliver the required features. That's much better than going in blind.

A side effect of collecting this timing data is that you also have a list of commonly repeated tasks in different projects. Perhaps you might be able to identify areas where you could make efficiency savings? For instance if you're often building a news feed or a product carousel or an FAQ page, you could set a side project for someone or a group of people to create a resusable module or library.

Nobody enjoys time tracking. It's methodical, laborious, repetitive and often seems a pointless waste of time. It doesn't guarantee that a project won't go over budget and people often see time tracking suspiciously, as if a slave master is sitting behind them making sure they don't stop working. Is my job under threat if I don't track a solid 8 hours or if the chap sitting next to me is clocking more hours? And yet everyone on the team needs to track their time in order for you to collect the valuable data you need to plan future projects. The main obstacles to proper time tracking are a combination of poor tools - difficult to use, overly detailed, not tailored to the individual or organisation's specific needs - and poor communication.

In terms of tools, there are more and more time-tracking solutions available all the time, many that are available as web apps or that integrate with offline desktop tools such as code editors. Maybe you might need different team members to adopt different tools depending what would have the least impact on their workflow. It would afterall defeat the purpose if people had to spend too much of the precious time you've planned for them tracking their time. Maybe you need your own bespoke tool (another great idea for a side project!) that's tailored to the roles and workflow or your team specifically. Deciding on tooling should be a team conversation and everyone should have a say. As long as you get your data.

Ultimately though, no matter what time tracking tools you decide upon, people aren't going to use them to their full potential, if at all, if they aren't personally invested in the reasons behind doing it. You need to communicate to the team the importance of time tracking for the organisation of the project as a whole and for the sake of future projects. It's not just about calculating bonuses or making your job easier. If you can't accurately assess how long a task takes them, you might inadvertently assign them too little time in future, or they may end up being assigned to multiple tasks or projects simultaneously due to the challenge of resource planning. By tracking their time, they are giving themselves enough time to do their work from now on. Tracking time leads to less overtime and more productive work time. It means the team/agency/company can produce better quality work because everyone will have enough time to do their jobs properly, and will generate enough revenue to cover the costs and make a profit, profit that will trickle down to everybody.

Try to make it a daily habit, something that can be done quickly, easily (even automatically?) and at the same time every day during less productive times, like at the start of each day, the end of each day, or just after lunch. It's your job to ensure everyone is tracking their time and if necessary to listen to and address the concerns of those who may not be.

### Functional Specifications

So far, you have a plan. You know exactly what needs to be done and achieved, who's going to do it, and rougly how long it's all going to take. The final step is getting all the details down so that everyone has exactly what they need to get started. This generally comes in the form of a document or series of documents called the Functional Specification. This is the project blueprint that everyone can take away and then get to work.

It's an ongoing reference point for everyone throughout the project lifecylce. We follow through the specs in every meeting and check against them before final delivery. The specs should generally remain static, although may need to be updated if features are changed, added, or cancelled. If you do need to change the specs, then be sure to implement some kind of version control system so nobody continues working on an outdated version.

The specs should have sections tailored to providing detailed information to each of the production team roles, so will likely be different for each project and team. We'll cover those main sections shortly but for now let's take note of some important features of such a document.

One of the main purposes of the functional specs is to provide a shared language for tools and features. Features or UI components need one specific and explicitly stated name that everyone can use when discussing it. For example, a carousel at the top of the homepage might be called a carousel by one person and a slider by another. A dropdown menu may be called a select input, a hover list, a tooltip menu, or a dropdown menu. A hero area may also be a masthead. A modal window may be a dialog box or a popup. And so on. Another consideration is that the people involved in the project may come from different backgrounds - creative, technical, marketing, sales, management, etc., maybe different industries, or different languages and cultures. The specs should normalise everyone and keep them all on the same page, so to speak.

Designing a good functional spec is a skill in itself. The information needs to be presented in a simple and clear way that's easily understandable by everyone. The specs should be as detailed as possible without being overly complicated, so you'll have to find a balance. It should be possible for all project stakeholders to pick up the spec and easily envisage what a certain feature should do. The documentation can easily be over-complicated by superfluous information and messy diagrams or annotations. If there is a wireframe diagram featuring several buttons, try and find a way to make it obvious that those are buttons through consistent styling rather than filling the page with arrows and the word "button". Likewise don't label those buttons with coded serial numbers that need to be referenced in a table 14 pages down by a cell that says "this is a button". You'd be surprised just how many functional specs are produced by agencies every day all over the world that are 99% mental diarrhea.

Finally the specs should be easily shareable and accessible. They could be composed in many different forms or document formats but make sure it's one that everybody, every project stakeholder, can download and open whenever and wherever they are using any device. Something like a shared Google doc might be a good idea, but you'd want to restrict editing access - only you should have control over it. Otherwise a PDF on a shared server directory or web link. If it's 300MB you might want to break it up into more manageable sections.

For an example functional specification document template, see _Appendix D: Functional Specifications_.

#### The Users

Right at the top of the specs is what everyone foremost in their minds throughout the project - the users.

This can be a simple reiteration of the target demographic described in the original project proposal / scope of work. What we might want to consider is:

* Who the average users are
* Where they are from
* What languages they speak
* How old they are
* What jobs they do
* What they are interested in
* What other web products they use
* What devices they use
* What time they usually interact with the web
* What their internet connections are like

All of these factors can and should influence content, design, and implementation decisions. For example older users might require more formal language and larger font sizes. Users on slower connections might require a more heavily optimised payload. Users on touch screen devices will obviously need to use tap, swipe and drag gestures rather than clicks, hovers, and keyboard shortcuts.

Hopefully this research has been done already by this point and the information is at hand. Maybe the project owner may be able to provide some insight, especially if they have any existing web projects from which to draw data.

How about user stories? These are simple to produce and are very popular in fast-paced agile project management methodologies. Without them, your functional specs may be overly concerned with features - what you are building for your client or project owner. User stories, as the name suggests, places focus and emphasis on the user. The idea is to identify some example or hypothetical user _roles_ (after all, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to gather data from real users), the type of users that will be using the project once it's launched, why they would want to use it, and what they need in order to use it easily. For example:

As a **reader of history books**
I would like to **search for history books** that I want to read
So that **I can buy them**

As a **site administrator**
I would like to be able to **take payment** for books
So that I can **receive money** before I send books to people

These are also helpful for you to prioritise you and your team's ideas, using words like must, should, could, and would.

#### Performance Budget

The next most important thing to always consider is the performance budget. We've covered PBs earlier in this chapter but this is where the budget should be written down and shared. Try to be as explicit as possible about all required metrics and ensure that all metrics are testable.

Performance is crucial and it's not just a case of coding more efficiently, chasing memory leaks, or choosing the right database system. Performance starts with content and design and so everybody is responsible for working within this budget.

#### Information Architecture

Here we have to determine the main sections or content categories of the project and how they fit together. For web projects are, on the whole, content delivery services. The end result of such an analysis, and what should be put in this section, is probably something akin to a sitemap. It may be a tree diagram, a table, a simple list, or something else. The goal is to illustrate what kind of content should be available to the user and how they might access and interact with it (maybe add, change, or delete it).

Why should this be in the functional specs? Because it guides everything from content strategy to UI design to database schema and endpoint API design. In other words, everyone needs to know about it.

For example if you're building a blog, your content sections may be a section about you and then your blog articles. Your blog articles may then also be categorised. You may have multiple authors. You may have a ratings sytem. You may want to be able to archive articles, and organise and filter them according to date, author, category, popularity, and so on. A news section may have sub-sections with different pages that may require different styles.

Think of it like a biologist ranking and classifying plants or animals by kingdoms, phyla, species, and sub-species. At each stage they are listing the name and the attributes that are shared among the sub-stages, adding more distinguishing attributes as they go further down the tree. Likewise you are here identifying the main information sections, describing the attributes of that information in detail (e.g. date, author, category, what the user might be able to change/add/delete), and then going on to detail sub-sections and sub-sub-sections.

This information directly translates to relational database schemas and classes and objects in the code, as well as providing designers with an initial idea of how the different kinds of information might need to be presented and used.

#### Content Guidelines

Content strategy comes under the role of a content manager so we shalln't go into too much detail here (See _Chapter 6: Content Managers_). If it's not you covering that role then you'll need to work closely with whoever is in order to fill out this section.

A robust content strategy is essentially a set of policies to be followed for all content throughout the project and is used for generating and maintaining that content. What's all too often forgotten in web content strategy is that content isn't just the words on the page, but also includes all of the meta data and media. That means that everyone needs to be aware of it whether writing, desiging, coding, or testing, right from the start.

A content strategy should basically cover these main areas:

* **Editorial strategy** - values, voice, tone, style, legal and regulatory concerns, etc.
* **Metadata** - the data about the content that can be read by search engines, 3rd-party apps, screen readers etc.
* **SEO** - how content should be optimised for search, links, keywords etc.
* **Content channel distribution** - how and where content will be generated, published, maintained, and made available to users

You'll also want to include specific rules, as with the performance budget, that absolutely must be followed throughout the production process. For example, you may want to put here the WCAG2.0 guideliness for ensuring accessibility.

#### Design Guidelines

Designers face the daunting challenge of starting with a completely blank canvas. We can make that challenge less daunting perhaps by filling in the canvas with things like colours or wireframe diagrams.

Branding and colours is probably the best place to start and can often be easily extracted from the project owner's existing branding. They probably have a logo, some corporate typefaces, colours, even perhaps a brand style guide. These may not all be easily translatable to the web but that's a problem that the designer should resolve - this will at least get them started.

Personality is another important factor. What kind of product is it? Who is it aimed at? Should the style be stiff and sharp, or soft and rounded? This sort of information is difficult to convey. The user information above helps to some extent. Other ideas might be to discuss with the client a persona for the project - what would it be like if it was a person? Or otherwise check the industry competition and see if there are any other similar projects from which we can take inspiration. The project owner probably has a few ideas, and remember that we're selling the project not just to their **users** but to them, so their personal preferences should be taken into account as well. They are the ones that have to make an ongoing investment in the project and so they will be more likely to stay committed and passionate if it matches their personal tastes exactly. It also highlights to designers and developers potential areas of over-complexity, and therefore to you which tasks may take the most time.

You know what wireframes are, right? They're just no-colour, skeletal diagrams of parts of the website or application used for planning the structure and functionality. They can be quite controversial. They can be a big waste of time. They can be wildly misused. At the most basic level, they should be quick and easy to produce and should communicate exactly what needs to be featured on every part of the project, nothing more and nothing less. For example, if I go to this page or view this component, there should be XYZ input elements and a button; the button can be labelled to explain what happens when it's clicked. Without wireframes, even if you have a detailed feature lists, your mental model of the project remains an disconnected list of ideas. By seeing something more visual, everyone can imagine more easily how everything will fit together and work for the users.

There are a multitude of tools these days for creating wireframe diagrams so you'll just have to try some and pick one you like. The best one though is probably a good old fashioned pen and paper. It's quick, easy, and everyone can use it. The major drawback with pen and paper is messy handwriting, so if you're drunk or you happen to have a medical doctorate then perhaps delegate this job to someone else. Also, if you need to present your wireframes to a client then you may need something more professional looking than hand-sketches that you've snapped on your phone camera, but that probably depends on the client. You might also waste time creating duplicate wireframes - if 2 sections of the project are going to look the same or have the same features, then just write a sentence to that end rather than spending time, and potentially wasting paper and/or kilobytes, drawing diagrams.

As with any attempt at clear communication, consistency is key. Make sure each diagram is drawn and labelled in the same way so that if someone looking at it can understand one diagram, they can understand the rest just as easily. It's important to find the right balance in terms of the level of detail. Overly detailed wireframes are difficult to quickly understand, thus defeating the purpose. Too simple diagrames conversely may fail to communicate required information. It's common practice to simply draw some diagrams of what should feature on each part of the application, along with placeholder content, and label those diagrams with numbers that reference more detailed explanations in the feature list. Simple wireframes lend themselves well to an interactive process where the diagrams can be repeatedly refined with detail added as necessary. It's a great idea to produce them in collaboration with the project owner to ensure that all the information gets taken down, like a police sketch artist putting together an assailant's facial features based on the witness' memories.

Wireframes are not a design tool. They should not convey colours, styles, sizes, or even layout. A designer may use them to determine what they should put on their canvas, not where nor how it should look. A modal or popup window should never feature in a wireframe diagram. Instead the popup content should be placed in its own wireframe diagram and then the designer can determine where it is best displayed, be that inside a popup window or not. Likewise any labels should not impose design decisions and words like full-screen, expandable, blue, big, hover, animated etc. should be avoided. 

The wireframe diagrams show only content and functionality features, and how they are organised and prioritised, that a designer can then style and move into place. Ideally, interactive wireframes could be generated directly using HTML & CSS, allowing for a rapid start to design and development.

#### Feature List

Here you go into full detail about what every part of the website or application should **have** and **do**.

This should probably take the form of a table, where each feature has a name or number (remember above we talked about a shared language that everyone can use to reference parts of the project?), alongside a details step-by-step description. It pairs well with wireframes, providing additional information that's not always easy to convey visually. For example:

* **Products Inventory**: Display a list of available products, paginated in groups of 12. For each product in the list, show the name, image, price, category, rating, and an add to cart button. Clicking on a product shows the product detail section. Clicking the add to cart button adds the product to the shopping cart.

* **Product Detail Section**: This shows the product information including the name, desciption, category, manufacturer, amount in stock, rating, and up to 10 images of the product. There is an add to cart button which adds the product to the shopping cart, and a button to return the user to the products inventory section.

As with wireframes, a picture speaks a thousand words. For complex features it's a good idea to provide an accompanying user flow diagram that will help reinforce the reader's mental model of how that feature should work. This will hopefully get people thinking about the implementation details - maybe there will need to be success/failure notifications? Should it be animated? Do we need a loading indicator? etc.

Also just as wireframes are not a design tool, a features list is not concerned with technical aspects; it's up to the developer how to best implement a feature. Note that in the features list we do not talk about design issues either. We don't mention a “blue” button or a “small image”. We keep the language, simple, informal, and easy for everyone to understand.

#### Timings

The last thing everybody needs to stay aware of (or maybe the first?) is the timeline, showing project phases, assigned tasks, dependencies, milestones, and deadlines. You may want to incude a timeline diagram directly in the specs or at least reference a shared calendar which people can check each day.

Now, you're finally ready to kick off the project.

## Comunication & Workflow

OK so that's the easy part over. You've got your plan and your team is good to go. This section is all about what your role involves throughout the rest of the project, from kick-off to delivery, which will roughly be akin to juggling with chainsaws. Your tasks will largely depend, like so much else, on the kind of project you're putting together, the kind of project owner you're working with, and the personalities of the rest of your team.

Your day to day tasks on any one particular project will mainly involve meetings, updating or refining plans, asking questions, and sending status reports. If you have the time and capability, and your team are stretched, you may also need to step in and help with production directly as well. 

There are many different project management methodologies - you've no doubt heard words like waterfall, agile, scrum - but you don't really need to formally stick to any of them. Find your own methodology that works for you and your team. Saying that, there are some good and bad aspects to any methodology.

### “Agile”

Earlier we talked about timeline diagrams, otherwise known as gantt charts, and even mentioned that they look like waterfalls, with the early tasks on the top left sequentially flowing down to the final tasks on the bottom right, with all the dependencies along the way. That is not to say that such diagrams enforce the classic “waterfall” methodology. Rather those diagrams just give you a simpler way to track project progress and communicate the project lifecycle to all stakeholders. However, they do tend to lend themselves to the waterfall methodology and are often abused. It's easy to just enter abstract and over-arching phases like "design", "front-end development", "back-end development", and "testing" with one flowing onto the next. Not only is it easy to put on a diagram, it's easier for us to understand because those are clearly defined chunks of work, probably handled by different people or teams. Likewise it's easier for the clients to understand - they can probably grasp what "design" entails and it's nice for them to be able to see clear end points. It seems to make the project more manageable because you can focus on just one set of tasks at a time and manage resources more easiy. While the back-end developers are working on this project, the front-end developers have already finished so they can get to work on the next project, right? If you think this is a good approach then you have 2 options:

**Option 1**

1. Open a maps app
2. Find the nearest tall building, cliff, or bridge. Ideally it should be at least 80m high.
3. Go to the top of that tall building, cliff, or bridge.
4. Stand right on the edge, facing the abyss
5. Jump forward

**Option 2**

1. STOP. STOP. STOP!
2. Change your wicked ways

The waterfall methodology simply does not work with web projects. Never. Ever. It doesn't work for the following reasons:

It's vital to remember that a website or app is not a magazine. You're not putting together a collection of pages, but rather a set of reusable features or modules, and the content, design, development, and testing work for each module is **inter-dependent**. You can't put web pages together without those modules. A traditional newspaper or magazine article may be put together by the author passing on content to an editor who passes it to a designer, who places it into a template and adjusts it, before the editor passes all pages on to the printer, who then goes on to deliver it to the distributer, and so on. If the content is too long then it can just overrun onto another page using the same template. The distributer doesn't care about that. If the content on a webpage is too long then it could potentially break the layout. That would necessitate design adjustments, code changes, and cross-browser testing. Everybody would need to react. In a waterfall methodology, nobody has chance to react until much later, at which point it may be too late. Late changes jeopardise deadlines and may themselves have unforseen consequences that cascade into more changes. Last-minute, hasty reactions rarely bring about quality solutions.

We just made the important point that design, development, and testing, are inter-dependent. Web designs can only be realistically assessed when viewed in a browser on different devices. That necessitates that it be coded up and tested. The designer will need to see it, use it, interact with it, before they can be done with this task and move on to the next. Likewise, a developer will need to know that what they have built works well on all required platforms before they can move on. Maybe they will need to reuse that module later. If it doesn't work or has any problems then it may have a large impact further down the line.

There is a major problem with designers, developers, and testers working independently and that's that there can be no mutual transfer of skills, knowledge, and understanding. Designers have little opportunity to learn of the constraints introduced by the code, and developers may not appreciate the potential user experience benefits when faced with complex designs. Instead of working together towards the best solution, they're each trying to get their own job done with as little difficulty as possible, resenting each other when difficulties arise. Likewise testers need to understand the creative and technical implementation in order to asses and identify problems, otherwise they may be seen as being obstructive when they raise ill-informed bug reports.

Waterfall phases increase the risk of delays. You've allocated 2 weeks or design and 4 weeks for development. What if the design is so complex that the developers will need 6 weeks to implement it? This added complexity is probably also going to require more time for testing and bug fixes. Suddenly your deadline has to be pushed back by a month, you've gone way over budget, and the project owner isn't happy. In the mad rush to complete the project as soon as possible, the work you've produced isn't your team's best. With this risk of unforeseen delays, you as the project manager cannot confidently assess at any stage how far through the project you are. Indeed it's more difficult to plan timings from the start if you can't, say, assess the impact on testing time that the design solution will bring about.

It's also much more difficult to react to changes, be they requests from the project owner or unforseen problems that necessitate a change. A change may need you to go back to the design phase - what if the designers are already working on another project? - then go back through the developers and testers, both of whom are already working on other tasks. That meticulous plan you spent so much time on at the start is now out - you have to start all over again, although now it's much more difficult to assess timings because everybody's busy and you're under a lot more pressure. The inability to react well to changes means you have to rely even more on an extremely detailed and fool-proof plan at the start, yet another risk.

Throughout a waterfall project, you have little or nothing to show. At the end of a design phase maybe you have some static mockups or a UI style guide. That's not very easy for a project owner to assess and provide feedback on. Similarly during the devlopment phase the best you can show them is a broken, unfinished website or app. Any feedback they can provide will surely be influenced by the less than optimal experience. Waterfall methodologies necessitate “big reveals”, where a curtain is unveiled at the end of the project and all the project owner's feedback is expected at once. What if they hate it? What if they want lots of changes? There is now a very large and real risk that you're going to miss the deadline, go over-budget, and probably antagonise your already weary team with all the repeat work they have to do. Your boss isn't happy with you either because you're now eating into profits and you have other projects waiting. Most project managers have been in this situation and know how horribly depressing it is. If you're feeling down and out, how are you supposed to keep driving the team? Do you even still care about making this project great?

Finally the most heinous crime of waterfall model adherents is that testing is necessarily left to the end. As a result, it's the first phase on the chopping block when the shit hits the fan, and as web project managers we all have pretty shitty fans and smeared walls. If testing and bug fixing isn't done, or even if it's rushed then you haven't produced quality work. Unless your production team is magically made up of Iron Man, Chuck Norris, Aslan, David Hasslehoff and the like, you are guaranteed to have bugs that will seriously impact the product's usability for some users, and potentially impact the product owner's business. Major fail.

So what's the alternative?

You've no doubt heard of “agile”. It's mostly a popular buzz word that many agencies surely throw about without really understanding it or properly adhering to the methodology. Agile came about in the 1990s as a methodology for software development. It places an emphasis on self-organising cross-functional teams who work on short, fast, flexible iterations. Following agile methodologies is actually a proven best practice for building software. This is the official _Agile Manifesto_:

* Individuals and interactions over Processes and tools
* Working software over Comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over Contract negotiation
* Responding to change over Following a plan

Essentially what this means is that a small and focused team is put together with a minimal feature list. They work on these discrete features in daily, weekly or monthly iterations or “sprints”, starting by producing the most basic version and then gradually improving it. At the end of each sprint, priorities are evaluated and feedback is incorporated into the feature before the next sprint is run. A sprint doesn't start until the previous one is finished; it's not about trying to cram as much work as possible into the pre-defined sprint time and then just moving on regardless. Agile methodologies are generally more suited to projects that have tight deadlines imposed on them and require rapid development at the possible expense of quality, where the scope isn't clearly defined and the final outcome unclear, where the designers and developers are highly-skilled, adaptable, and able to think independently.

Hang on a minute. After reading that, alarm bells should be ringing. No comprehensive documentation? No following of plans? No clearly defined scope? No clear outcome?! Throughout this chapter we've been emphasing the critical importance of documentation and planning and clearly defined scope!

So maybe a mixed approach may be best. Never follow any methodology too strictly - nobody can prescribe the perfect solution for you and your team. Just try to focus on what's important - quality - and plan to take as much time as is needed to achieve the best you are able to with the budget and resources available. The most important principles to take from Agile are everyone working closely, and having a fully testable deliverable at the end of each sprint. Maybe consider each sprint as a mini-waterfall with its own design, development, and testing phases. Content must always come first and inevitably each feature will require some initial design work. Testing obviously can't be done until there's some code to test. This will make for harder planning as each role may need to work longer on different features. At least there will be a constant stream of finished and tested features coming through rather than waiting for the big reveal weeks or months down the line.

It's a big shift in the way that traditional teams work but it's a necessary one, especially in the age of the multi-device web, a.k.a. “responsive design”. Everything needs to be adapted for and tested on different devices which increases the potential risk if things need to be changed to accommodate one platform or another.

We also still need to thoroughly plan and document web projects. Web projects are not software projects from the 1990s and they have the added complexity of project owner interference and collaboration, which the traditional agile methodology doesn't really accommodate. The complexity and mutability of the web necessitates good preparation. So just as you would with a traditional waterfall model, prepare thoroughly first - information architecure, content strategy, etc. before diving into the sprints (i.e. discrete periods working on specific features or feature sets). How long sprints are depends on your team and your projects.

Let's run through a simple example. You've got your detailed plan and your timeline and your functional specs. Maybe the timeline just has a planning phase, a production phase (that entails many loops of content, design, development, and testing), a changes or optimisation phase that can be squeezed if necessary, and a delivery phase. Several features in, you come to the website navigation menu. You know from your plan what the information architecture is and how the site can be split into sections. Your content manager first takes an hour or so thinking about what the navigation menu options should be, what the wording should be for each option, plus any tooltips or accessibility meta data. When they're finished the designer is going to need some time playing with the look and feel and also the behaviour on different devices. The developer is sitting next to them prototyping these ideas using real content. When they're both happy with the solution, it goes to the tester who tries it out in all required platforms, browsers, and devices. Maybe a few simple changes, tweaks, or fixes are required and then the sprint is over. Maybe it was just 1 days' work, but you now have a real navigation menu that's using the real content, looks great, and works great on all devices. You can then have this deployed to a staging server and take it back to the client manager or product owner for review; they can look at and interact with the real thing rather than an unrealistic static mockup. Let's assume, perhaps optimistically, that they provide feedback straight away. Another quick round of changes and testing later you get sign off from the project owner and we're done. Everyone's happy. Next feature. But what's the content manager doing while everyone else is busy? Working on the next feature or another project. What's the tester doing while the designer and developer are working? Restesting a previous feature or on another project. Everyone will need to manage their time independently and help out wherever they can.

There are many advantages to this kind of approach:

Changes are really easy to handle. You can probably insert a sprint without any major impact on the timeline. At least the impact of adding a new sprint on the timeline is clear. The whole idea of Agile - the clue is in the name - is that it's faster and more reactive. You may find yourself actually ahead of schedule occasionally, allowing enough time for you to insert a sprint in the timeline to work on further improving or refining a previous feature. Another consequence of changes being easy to handle is that you can afford to be more experimental with new tools, techniques, and technologies. You can try something, test it, and if it doesn't work then redo it. At worst your team learns something new. At best your work is cutting edge.

By breaking the project down into these small, easy to manage sprints with fully working deliverables at the end of each, there is more opportunity for reviews, testing, prioritisation, and for ultimately honing in on exactly what the project owner wants. The results from this continued testing and feedback will inform the ongoing work, ensuring that you're less likely to encounter problems or miss the mark in terms of the project owner's expectations. If it was especially difficult to tease out of them at the start exactly what they wanted then this is the ideal approach. Even if it wasn't, you're forcing the project owner to be involved in the production process, investing their time and energy into it, and educating them about your design decisions throughout. They will be in a much better position to go on maintaining the project once you hand it over, hitting the ground running. By gathering feedback as you go along, based on a real working solution, you are reducing the risk of major change requests later down the line.

Bugs are **much** easier to handle. Bug tracking and fixing is always a pain point in any project. QA testers may report duplicate bugs, developers may feel frustrated that they've been sent a pile of emails about something that isn't necessarily their fault - maybe it's a browser issue that's caused by some ill-informed design decision. Psychologically, a bug report is like firing an arrow at a developer, punishing them for a mistake; they don't want to go back and try to hack something they worked on weeks ago and now vaguely remember; not only is it more difficult to get back into the logic of such code (especially if they didn't have the time or motivation to provide good documentation, which they likely didn't!), they just want to carry on building useful stuff. The main problem with bug fixing is that it's often impossibe to determine how long the bugs will take to fix, harder than time planning for the original feature. That means that having a long testing phase at the end leaves you with an unknown fixing phase that places your deadline at risk. When deadlines are looming, work gets sloppy - weeks of work could be ruined by some last-minute dirty hacks. As they struggle to recall their code, they may inadvertedly break things while they're fixing others. This risk could be mitigated by unit testing, but we'll get to that later. The smaller the iteration, the faster and easier the testing and fixing we be. By doing the testing and fixing for each individual feature straight after it's been built, the code is already fresh in the developers' minds and they will be able to make a much better job of it. Therefore continuous and early testing drastically improves overall quality.

By breaking the project own into short and manageable iterations, you have ultimate visibility on project progress. You'll know exactly when you've built 25% of the features and will have a much better idea of how long it will take to build the other 75%, for instance. That means that even if you underestimated the time it will take, you can react quickly and set the project owner's expectations early, as opposed to reaching the deadline and realising you still have a long way to go - you either have to keep going at maximum pace, sacrificing quality, or massively disappoint your client. Probably both.

At any point in the project, you'll have something ready to launch. Even if it's only a skeleton feature set, not yet fleshed out to meet all of the original requirements, you at least have some real content in a good design that's been coded up and properly tested. If anything goes wrong, such as budget suddenly drying up or an industry change that requires work to stop while the project owner takes time to react, you could still launch or deliver if you wanted to. This may even work in the project's favour if you have chance to gauge the users' reactions and behaviour - data that could inform the rest of the work once the project resumes. This is in fact the “Minimum Viable Project” idea - launching the most basic possible feature set as early as possible and then continuing to upgrade and deploy. This approach may be especially appealing to owners or projects that generate revenue or are seeking further investment because they start getting a return on their initial investment earlier and have data to take to potential investment partners.

Also relating to the project owner's bank balance is the fact that changes, being easier to handle, become much cheaper. If in the feedback loop at the end of an iteration they realised they need to go back and change something, you can repeat the iteration and then adjust the timings for the remaining ones. They can asses the value of the change against the risk to the deadline and the additional cost incurred by the increased work. On the other hand if they realised at the end of a project that they need major changes or what you've produced isn't what they were expecting then only 3 things can happen:

* they don't pay you, you don't deliver, and everyone's time is wasted and moods soured
* they reluctantly pay you but have to pay you more to make the changes, souring the relationship and probably destroying their ongoing commitment to the product you've built
* they insist on the changes but don't pay you anymore, so you have to slave away for free

All of these things are bad for the web.

Advantages rarely come without disadvantages so we'd be remiss to not cover those too. The adaptability of the approach and responsiveness to changes brings an inherent risk. Changes can become too easy, too tempting. It comes back to a good plan and good project management control to ensure that the final product matches what was originally proposed. As you go along, maybe you, your team, or the client will have some great ideas that you have chance to implement. But if they take you further away from the original business goals then they should be given serious consideration and probably stay on the table for a future upgrade project. Similarly the added flexibility allows for potential scope creep. Try to resist the temptation to add features that are beyond the original scope, even if you have time and budget available, unless there is a solid business case for them. Instead explain to the project owner that this feature can be considered after the final milestone for this project.

Nor do agile methodologies ameliorate the fear of uncontrolled costs and deadlines. You still don't really know how much you can get done in a particular sprint or how many sprints it will take to complete all the required features as agreed at the start of the project. You may still reach the deadline having not completed the feature set and have to disappoint the project owner by asking for more time and money. However, as we mentioned just now, it's much easier to foresee this kind of situation coming and preemptively consult with the project owner; you also still have a fully designed, developed, and tested project they can launch if required.

Rapid sprints necessitate rapid feedback loops. This may irritate some clients if they are particularly busy, on a different schedule or timezone, or just want to sit back and leave you to it. In such circumstances you'll need to assign someone as a proxy who can provide feedback and recommendations with the client's personal tastes and business goals in mind. You should understand them pretty well, so this might just be you! This should at least reduce the chance of your team producing anything too different from the client's expectations and necessitating a large feedback and revisions loop at the end of the project. In any case, this is a potential problem with any methodology, not just this one.

It takes a big commitment by all stakeholders to make this kind of pseudo-agile process work. This can't be understated. Everyone has to do their best to keep themselves motivated, on track, and work together closely. Status meetings cannot be skipped, feedback cannot be dismissed or left unsought. If one person doesn't participate fully, they obstruct everybody else. Hopefully over time, processes become habitual. Even more hopefully perhaps, proven results should motivate everyone to get with the programme.

By now the benefits of a close-knit team working together iteratively towards the best possible solution should be clear. Undoubtedly you find the idea quite daunting as it depends on you being able to maintain strict control over the project. That's where good planning, documentation, regular status meetings come in, and also a good solid kick-off.

### The Project Kick-Off Meeting

By this stage, you've been learning and thinking a lot about this project. You hopefully have some background information, a feature list, maybe even stakeholder interviews. You have a pretty good idea of what needs to be done and how your team might be able do it.

The kick-off meeting is your opportunity to run everything by your team, a high-level outline, and confirm or change any assumptions you have. It informs the entire project plan as laid out in the functional specifications. You're going to assemble the entire team so they can all hear the same message, set expectations, get the same documentation and information, and review the requirements. Ultimately, it's about assigning work and gathering more detailed information for your planning purposes. It's also a great opportunity to energise them and get them excited about the project. Too often kickoff meetings can be dull and uninspiring, or people can't get enthused about a new project because they're already so busy with another one. That's why it's important to first consider the purpose of the meeting and how you can make the most of it.

It's important to have a kick-off meeting for the following reasons:

* Everyone can become clear about the core objectives
* Everyone on the team becomes familiar to each other
* You can get important details from every team member and make everyone aware of it - details about implementation and timings
* It promotes active communication among team members

Things you will want to discuss in the meeting are:

* Why? What are the project objectives? How should the project meet user/consumer needs?
* Who? Who is going to do what?
* What? What are we going to do/make?
* How? How are we going to work together to make it happen?
* When? How long do we need to make it?

#### Be Prepared

Whether you already have basic functional specifications put together or not, you need to come into the meeting with as much useful information as possible. At the very least you should be aware of the project goals and deliverables, enough to know who on your team needs to be involved. Ideally you'll have detailed information from the project owner about their background, business needs, users or customers. You'll have stakeholder interviews, style and content guidlines, a feature list, technical requirements, server and domain information, analytics data, key performance indicators, required deliverables, and anything that will help your team to get started. Gather as much information as possible, even if you don't plan to formally present it someone on the team might ask a question and you'll be prepared. You could even get feedback from certain team members while you're in this information gathering phase to learn more about what they might need to know. The more prepared you are the more likely it is that the team will trust your judgement and follow your lead throughout the life cycle of the project.

All the information you have is probably compiled into some kind of project plan or functional specifications outlining all the tasks, responsibilities, and timeframes. While this should get you off to a good start, it's important to realise that such a plan is, at this stage, not set in stone. In fact it should never be. You'll undoubtedly have a list of questions or assumptions that you must also bring to this meeting. In presenting the plan to the team, asking questions, and gathering feedback, you'll be able to refine and validate it. Given that the outcome of the meeting will allow you to furnish your plan, ensure you arrange it well enough in advance of the project start date so that you can compile the information for everyone before they begin. Early scheduling will also ensure that everyone is available and that the meeting itself doesn't eat into the project work time.

The final preparation step is actually scheduling the meeting at a time that best suits everyone. But who is everyone?

#### Identify Attendees

Who you willl need on your project depends entirely on the requirements. Certainly if you have a client liaison you'll want them there to represent the project owner's requirements and expand on those if necessary, also to gather any questions they may need to take back to the client. You'll also want people in senior roles involved - team leaders and managers, so that they can get a good overview of the project's scope and how it might impact them. You'll want operations people - anyone who might be involved in providing logistical support such as setting up servers and code repositories. Obviously you'll need every single person who may be working on the project. It's a good idea to try and invole as many people as possible; it's better to have someone there that you might not need that miss someone important who may need to be involved at some later stage.

The thing to be wary of with such a potentially big meeting is that the more people you have the more risk there is of interruptions and conflicting opinions. Therefore you'll need to establish protocols, perhaps arranging short breaks in which people can go to the bathroom or check their emails, as well as chairing discussions yourself, gathering and collating opinions separately then making decisions yourself after the meeting.

Ensure that you maintain a contact list containing everyone's names and contact details that you can share out; everyone needs to get to know eachother and understand how responsibilities are going to be shared out.

#### What to Cover

Start with the intended results and outcomes, what you're going to be handing over to the project owner. Tell everybody the explicit objectives - the project KPIs we discussed earlier. You need to be sure that everyone has been made aware of these and by stating them explicitly at the start of the meeting you are highlighting their importance.

Briefly go through the project background if you think you have time and that it would be useful, otherwise refer people to your documentation. You need to keep the pace and try not to waste anybody's time - the point is to assign tasks to individual people so that everyone knows what they and others need to do to pull the project off. In that case, try and dive straight into the task or features list as soon as possible. For each feature, explain what's involved, answer questions or note them down to answer later when you have more information, and at the same time try and tease out information about timings. The team will hopefully have lots of feedback and questions so you should be taking notes as you go along.

As well as going through each task or feature, you'll want some more open discussions about general topics. For instance, you'll need to discuss the most appropriate technology stack, the logistical requirements, the copy and media requirements, the look & feel, and how the project is to be deployed and delivered. If you know already, you should also make everyone aware of any hard deadlines as well as ongoing support requirements.

#### Make it Fun

Sequentially going through features and assigning tasks all sounds very dull. It won't be easy to make people feel engaged or excited about the project when you're just piling work on them and asking how long it's going to take. Find ways to involve others as much as possible and try not to do most of the talking. Certainly don't just make this meeting about reviewing your documents - people can go away and do that in their own time!

Don't be afriad to force people out of their comfort zone. When discussing the design for example, perhaps have a brainstorming session involving the developers; they may even know about some handy new tools or libraries that could excite the designers. How about preparing screenshots of similar products that everyone can discuss and asses, giving each their own ratings. You could try and devise some sort of diagrams or charts to draw on a whiteboard that can represent task priorities or feasibility. Maybe write down tasks and associated names on index cards and have everyone try and sort them in order. Or another idea is fishbowl conversations, discussions about a particular topic in which only people sitting in particular chairs are allowed to speak. If anyone wants to join the conversation they must claim a chair and someone else must vacate it. You could enforce time limits on speaking and force everyone to take a turn in the chair. Meanwhile a moderator, you in this case, guides the discussion and summarises it at the end.

Maybe you think these are silly ideas, but you may find that people appreciate a break from the traditional meeting format. What's crucially important is that everyone is engaged and involved. You don't want anyone walking out of the meeting having not said or contributed anything. They were in there for a reason.

#### Stay Focused

Even if you decide to incorporate some fun activities into the kick-off, you need to ensure you stay on track and achieve the objectives of the meeting - making key decisions and gathering the required information. You also need to ensure you can do all this in as little time as possible so as not to disrupt people's work. It's especially difficult to stay on track when you have lots of people in the room.

You'll want to have a meeting agenda, listing discussion points in order, and constantly reference the project objectives throughout each discussion. You'll need also to find a way to steer the conversation if it's veering off-topic or to help someone try and summarise their point if they're talking for too long. You may also have to face down arguments by again summarising the key points on either side and pushing to move on.

#### Review

Before the meeting closes, run through with everyone the deliverables, due dates, and a summary of the key points discussed. Before you go away and update the documenation, calendars etc. make a note of next steps and what will be required of everyone before the project starts, as well as where they might find any and all relevant information and documentation pertaining to the project. Finally, thank everyone for their help and their time.

### Daily Meetings

Assuming the kick-off went well and the project has now begun smoothly, your ongoing role in this project is one of an overseer and facilitator. That means you'll require constant updates about project status and will need to identify and react to any potential issues. You could send out a list of questions in emails to each team member individually, but that would take a lot of time (that you undoubtedly don't have!) and create information silos - only you will have a clear overall picture.

A great way to do this is to have a quickly daily standup meeting, otherwise known as a “scrum” meeting. This is where everyone gathers in one area and each person in turn says a few sentences about:
* What they are currently working on
* What might be blocking them, if anything
* What they will be moving onto next, and when

This kind of open meeting allows everyone to learn about what everyone else is doing, enforcing team solidarity and a sense of collaborative progress. Everyone must have a turn at speaking, even if they are not busy or have nothing to do. You can also take this opportunity to provide any updates or feedback from the project owner. Realistically, everyone can probably provide you an update in 20-30 seconds (not even enough time to sit down, hence the name “daily standup”), making for a very quick, non-disruptive meeting. Also in the interest of being non-disruptive, you'll probably want to schedule such meetings for first thing in the morning before everyone settles down to get in the zone, or just after lunchtime, etc. It can be tricky to find a good time, especially if anyone on your team is working remotely, but this meeting is just to help your work, so try to be as understanding and accommodating as possible.

Immediately following the meeting, you'll have some action items. You'll have to update your plan, update the client or client manager, seek the answers to any questions that were raised, and chase up anyone who's work is blocking someone else's to see if any help can be offered or tasks rearranged.

### Other Meetings

In this role it's unlikely that you'll get away with one meeting per day, it's just something you'll have to get accustommed to. All meetings have the e same basic objectives - to gather information and make decisions. You'll also be accustomed to taking notes and documenting everything. So what advice can we offer here?

1) Try not to let meetings descend into idle chit-chat. You need to get in, get what you came for, and get out, without coming across as rude, of course.

2) Record meetings. Scruffy scribblings on easy-to-lose bits of paper are unlikely to serve you as well as you think they might later on. Instead of trying to dual-focus on what's being discussed _and_ on taking down the important points, just use a recording app on your phone. Be honest and open about the fact that you're recording and note that you'll do it discretely. Name your archived recordings in a way that make sense. Don't record when it's unnecessary or inappropriate, e.g. budget discussions, conflict resolutions, pre-sales, etc.

3) Try to minimise context-switching. By that we mean disrupting people's momentum by randomly calling meetings or interrupting them at their desks. Schedule meetings in advanced or wait until people take a break or appear available before going to them for quick updates.

### Status Reports

Whether you're following a pseudo-agile methodology or not, it's a good idea to provide status reports at the end of each week or sprint. But why? You're already busy enough as it is, right?

Firstly, it conveys professionalism and will make the project owner, as well as your perhaps client manager, feel valued and respected. You may consistently deliver stunning projects, but if during the course of delivering those projects you leave your clients hanging, unaware of what's going on, or less than 100% confident that you're going to be on time and on budget, then they will not value your approach to business and may be reluctant to give you further work or recommendations.

It's also useful as an internal communication tool. If you're spending time putting together such a report then why not send it to your boss and evryone on your team? They should also be interested in the information it contains and may even be able to point out if there are mistakes before you submit it to the project owner.

Status reports highlight the inevitable issues that arise during the production of web projects. Therefore it can serve as a launchpad for conversations about finding solutions. Just like in your daily standup meetings, if everyone is made aware of a problem then everyone can do what they can to resolve it. There's the added advantage that issues are collated and communicated all at once rather than in various email threads, which may be a more eddficient way of dealing with them. It's a form of issue log that both your team and the project owner's team can be held accountable for.

The report should always include the latest project schedule. In fact the report's very raison d'être is to let everyone know whether the project is ahead of or behind schedule and why. The schedule will undoubtedly be updated regularly and so it would be a mistake to only show it to people at or just after the kick-off meeting, or to leave it languishing and ignored on a shared server somewhere. It's also a bad idea to leave communicated schedules until milestones, which may be weeks or months in the future, because web projects may change on a daily basis. Scheduling issues may highlight cause to secure more resources or de-prioritise requirements in order to stay on track. If the project owner is regularly updated on the project's timings, then should you need any difficult conversations about extensions you will have a series or shared documents to back you up. Changes to the schedule become easier to sell as a regular progression of schedule revisions higlights how the situation has come about.

As with schedules, keeping the project owner regularly updated on the budget will reassure them. If it's looking like the budget may be overrun, then they will be able to react early or extend the budget, having been kept informed along the way as to how this happened.

It's not just about providing the latest information either. The report should also include a list of high-level action items, a general weekly to-do list for both your team and the project owner's team, which supports project momentum and accountability. If someone fails to complete a stated task one week, then you can highlight here how it has affected the timeline.

The status report doesn't really have to take much time to compile. Once you have a template from the first one (or from *Appendix D*), all you need to do is quickly update the information each week. You should already have the latest schedule and budget figures to hand anyway. It's a constant challenge for a web project manager, juggling so many things, to stick to these formal processes. Project status reports may be deemed unimportant and may be one of the first things cast aside once Friday afternoon rolls around. However it does force good project management practice and it needs to become habitual It just takes discipline. By compiling these reports you are forced to review all the information yourself on a regular basis, reinforcing your control over the project. If you allow yourself to leave it for a week, two weeks, a month, then not only will it take longer but you'll be at a loss.

You can deliver status reports in whatever format you feel is appropriate, depending on your project owner and the tone of your organisation. Maybe a PDF, PPT, or even just in an email. What's important is that the format is clear and consistent and accessible to everyone. As well as the format, you may want to adapt the level of detail and communication style for each client. Hopefully communication details will have been established at the start of the project. Maybe your client will want daily updates. Maybe they're especially busy and not details-oriented so will not want lenghy reports. Maybe they're not technical so the language should be simplified and without jargon. Maybe they will want you to call them after sending the report and talk them through it.

It's important that the status reports don't contain any major surprises. If there are major issues that need to be raised, do so immediately, not at the end of the week as a footnote in a summary.

### Sprint Reviews

Don't worry, this isn't another type of meeting you have to have. This is just for you. As a web project manager, you'll likely be spending most of your time gathering data and applying it to detailed documentation. That's because data is used to drive decisions. At all stages of a web project we should be measuring how well we're coming along, not just in terms of adherence to schedule and budget, but to what extent we're on track to meet the project goals. Have the required features actually been completed to specifications? Does the solution work? At the end of each sprint you have the opportunity to play around with the work produced, proactively spotting issues and identifying areas for improvement and prioritisation. Indeed if you do find anything you think needs more work, you may have to call another meeting. Areas you might have to consider, always referencing the pre-stated KPIs, are:

* **Content**: does the copy confirm to the content styleguide? are the images and other media suitable a adapted for different devices? has all the required meta-data been included?
* **Aesthetic design**: is the look and feel consistent with the tone of the project and the previously completed work? Will the project owner like it? Will the users like it?
* **User interface design**: is it intuitive? does it perform well on different devices? is it accessible to disabled users?
* **Code**: is it clean, modular, re-usable, semantic, well-documented? are there any bugs or memory leaks? does animation run smoothly?
* **Test coverage**: were all the test cases completed? were any missing? will it stand up to scrutiny? how likely is it to break under certain conditions?
* **Feedback**: has analytics tracking been implemented? do the team have any concerns or questions of their own about a particular feature or feature set?
* **Performance**: how's the load time? what about the total payload? is the payload optimised for different devices or connections? have we made the best use of caching and data storage? are animations running at least 60fps? 

Exactly what you analyse and measure depends on you and your projects; you will need to equip yourself with the required level of understanding in each area in order to make useful judgement calls. The reason we do these reviews at the end of each sprint is to avoid disrupting project momentum. If you decide you want to change something on a previous feature, you don't want to interrupt the work on the current feature. You may decide however, especially for large or complex projects, to spend part of each day continuously reviewing the work rather than all at once at the end of each sprint. You may also decide not to do it alone, incolving the client or client manager for their business knowledge, or the rest of the production team themselves if they have time. Bear in mind that if you do come away with any problems or recommendations for improvement, the project owner should be consulted before you start adding work that may impact budgets and timelines, or changing the requirements. It may very well be the case that your team, no matter how good their skills or expert their knowledge or how hard they worked, have produced a solution that doesn't work or doesn't meet the requirements. You are ultimately responsible for ensuring requirements are met, so in such cases you will need to offer constructive feedback and suggestions.

Let's take performance as just one example, one that is all too often overlooked and considered the responsibility of someone else. Let's say you realise a particular module is too slow to load or too large a download. It's understandable because performance is notoriously difficult to stay on top of. New performance techniques are emerging all the time. The project's hardware and software is likely to change, just as web standards and browser technology continue to change. First let's go to the developers and ask their advice to see if there's any tricks we can apply, any quick wins. If not then we may have to adjust the content or design or functionality. Work with them to find a solution and avoid throwing blame around. If this solution is going to impact timelines, let everyone know. Certainly don't take matters into your own hands and try to fix anything yourself. The team will resent your interference and lack of transparency - “Why didn't you just ask us to fix it?” - and by always spending your time delving into other people's work you'll be putting yourself at risk of burnout. By all means help directly if the team is too busy or lacks the knowledge or skills, but always keep them informed of what you're doing and why.

If you notice the same kind of issues popping up time and time again, then that suggests areas where you team's skills may be lacking and where education and training is required. Converseley if requirements in a particlar area are consistently met, they should be celebrated and recognised publicly.

### Project Reviews

Otherwise known as a “post-mortem”, this is where the entire production team come together at the end of a project and discuss what went well and what didn't. It's basically a useful learning exercise that shouldn't take up too much of anyone's time.

You really want to try and tackle any problems that are found before the meeting is over. That means clearly defining any problems, identifying possible solutions, making decisions about which solution or solutions to adopt, and then assigning who is responsible for actioning them and when they should do so by.

Again, bring up the project KPIs set out at the start and discuss whether or not they have been fully met. If not then why not? If they have then pats on the backs all-round! Let's remind everyone about what went well, what they did right, what they can be proud of. What can be showcased as part of people's personal portfolios or presented to new potential clients to win more work? This is also your opportunity to assess against your own personal success criteria. Did this project go better than previous ones? Did you learn anything you can take to future projects? Was anyone in your team unhappy or unable to work to the best of their abilities? What can you do to fix that?

It's not just about identifying the good and bad parts, either. Remember that a web project is *never* finished. During production maybe your team thought of some new feature ideas. What else could be done to improve the project? What could be a potential future roadmap that can be presented to the project owner so that you can continue working on it?

Even though by now they may be bored of this project or tired of working on it, hopefully everyone can come away from this meeting re-energised and excited to get back into it.

## Setting Things Up & Getting Started

At the start of this chapter we described your role as “the enabler”. That means you are also responsible for ensuring that everyone on the team has everything they need in order to carry out the project work. What they will need depends on who you have in your team and what roles they fulfil, as well as what the project work entails. In all likeliness, most of your projects will be similar enough that these things may already be set up or that setting them up will be easy. Perhaps you have a dedicated operations person or support team to handle things like this, or otherwise you might have to do it yourself. Make sure that you check first with each team member what they need and have it set up for them *before* the project work is scheduled to begin.

Things like software, hardware, ergonomic furniture, or service subscriptions usually come with some non-trivial cost that you may need to justify to your boss. Try to prioritise what's needed and find a way to make the case for them. Luckily in this industry the equipment we need to do our work is generally quite cheap relative to the potential income it can generate. Take a top-of-the-range Apple computer for instance; yes, it's expensive, but it can do a lot, last for a long time, and hopefully costs only a fraction of the revenue from just 1 project.

### Software

The kinds of software tools we need are generally fairly limited. We need code editors, graphics manipulation tools, office packages, compilers, version control, deployment and file-sharing tools, etc.. Always consider using open-source or cloud-based software when available. Not only will this save you money, but such software often has widespread adoption, precisely because they're free or cheap, and therefore active communities around them, which means they are regularly updated and there are plenty of learning and support materials available. Choose software or frameworks that are commonly used by industry peers that do similar work to you. By all means if your organisation has some niche requirement that requires specific tooling then seek it out, but aside from the reasons above, generally sticking to industry-standard software (for example, Git for version control) has the added advantage that new team members will likely already be familiar with it and therefore require less training and onboarding.

Don't be afraid to swap out software when the industry starts to shift, or when a team member suggests something different. Ultimately, you have to support whatever will make your team members, both present and future, work most effectively. Similarly, don't shy away from dropping a software package, even if it is industry standard, if it's just not the right tool for the job. The industry hasn't always been right and hasn't always been quick to react to changes, a classic example being the number of organisations still using Adobe Photoshop for web design, despite it never having been appropriate - it's a complicated package that requires a huge time investment to learn and user, making people reluctant to drop it. In fact actively seeking out new software options can be a good exercise and opportunity for team training sessions.

### Shared Storage

Each project will have documentation that everyone on the team should have fast and easy access to. The project's deliverables, the design, the code, the test cases, etc. should also be stored somewhere accessible. You'll want to consider the security implications of this - should the storage be publicly accessible? Should everyone have their own password? Do you need to track or restrict who accesses what files? Should everyone be allowed to edit files or just view and download them? Should it be physically located in your office or on cloud storage? How will backups be handled? Should people be able to access it out of the office? IS any special formatting required, for example when sharing files with clients? There are many options as to how you handle this storage, some examples being a shared server, dropbox, Google drive, Atlassian tools etc. Otherwise a file sharing solution might be a fun side project for someone.

### Communication, Systems & Protocols

You'll definitely want to have some sort of instant messaging platform where people can quickly and easily discuss work and share files. In some cases, this kind of communication is less disruptive than walking over to someone's desk, and facilitates remote work. Having the other team members directly accessible like this also creates a sense of cohesion among the team. Again, multiple options are available such as Slack, Hipchat, Google hangouts, Skype, etc.

You might want to instigate communication protocols, such as quiet time or how people should indicate when they don't want to be disturbed. A fixed meeting schedule is a good idea, as is a way of scheduling meetings such that everyone can receive reminders and notifications no matter what devices they use.

Naming convenstions are important when it comes to saving and sharing files. Think about whether filenames should use spaces, hyphens, or underscores to separate words, capitalisation, version numbers, folders, colour labels, etc. This comes down to personal preference but consistency among the team will ensure that people will always be able to find and understand things easily and quickly.

> “The only real difficulties in programming are cache invalidation and naming things.”

> *- Phil Karlton*

Indeed naming conventions should extend to the code and graphics files as well in order for them to remain easily maintainable by everyone. Not just naming conventions either, style guides should be put in place that dictate how code should be written, specifying things like spacing and indentation, documentation blocks, and other formatting issues. It may be up to you to enforce these protocols, but that can be made easier through the use of automated linting tools that provide feedback and report errors during compile time. Messy and non-uniform code will be more difficult for new team members to pick up and will be more difficult for anyone to go back into to change or update.

It's always up to you to establish best practice and enforce it. Consider things like mobile-first, responsive design, and progressive enhancement that determine the way work is carried out. People on your team have their own limited subset of tasks and so may not consider these over-arching protocols as much as someone in your role with a view on the big picture. These phrases are actually buzz-words that people on your team are probably already familiar with. They may have a different understanding of them or may be working under false assumptions about what they entail. Responsive is a classic example, where a designer might think they are designing a responsive website and yet produce 3 different sized static mockups - responsive fail! You should set the tone and ensure that everyone knows what is required of them in terms of workflow.

As you are overseeing entire projects, keep on eye on the work to ensure that people are starting simple and gradually adding complexity. Remind everyone at the start of each project that they are building *systems*, not sites, or screens, or pages. You want your web projects to be stable, future-friendly, scalable, and extensible. For instance they should begin designing, building, and testing the most basic and reusable stuff - the typography, buttons, form inputs, grid systems, tables, etc. - the building blocks for all other components and modules. They should start off ensuring the basic feature requirements are met on the minimum system requirements - the oldest browsers and the smallest screens - before gradually enhancing the experience for more capable devices. This forces them to keep performance in mind and consider users who are not sitting at a comfortable desk like they are, on a fast wifi connection and using a high-end laptop. By facing the constraints head on from the start, designers and developers are forced to really think about the problems and how to solve them. It also ensures that time will be saved later on as they are able to re-use and build on previous work that's been tested and signed off.

The so-called “mobile-first” approach to design and development essentially means to start with the most basic user interface for small screens, maybe adding more content, design flourishes, and user-interface elements only if and when required as the screen size increases. We don't need to go into here the growth of the mobile web, nor the pace of new devices coming on the market from tiny wearables to large-screen displays. The mobile-first approach at least resets people's perspectives about what the web is. It's not just websites that you view on your laptop or desktop computer. This is especially important to project owners who may not be web professionals, and not spending most days considering things like this.

As we just mentioned, “responsive design” does not mean separate versions of your product for arbitrary “mobile”, “tablet”, and “desktop” devices, despite how often this misunderstanding is encountered. Reponsive means device agnostic, which in turn means that your products are not built for specific screen sizes, but for *all* screen sizes; your design should be fluid with the user interface, and possibly also content, adapting at points where it sudenly breaks or becomes less than optimal. All web projects, generally speaking, should be responsive unless you are building something for a very specific situation or environment and can guarantee that it will only be access on a particular screen size. Therefore ensure that everyone on your team is aware of what's required and that nobody is mistakenly producing work for specific screen sizes.

One of the most important project deliverables, even if it hasn't been specifically requested, is a style guide. It's one of the things you should be demanding of your team and making standard practice for all projects. Like with enforcing performance budgets, it's ok to be dogmatic about this because the benefits are clear:


- communication tool, demonstrates interactions
- get your head around the look and feel
- maintainability
- consistency
- forces modularity
- semantics / shared language
- relates to the code, forces organisation, workflow
- easier to test

can be automated



### Version Control

 a revision control system enables you to keep track of changes, revert anything that breaks, and keep rolling backups of your project.

The benefits only start there, and Charlie Perrins recommends using source control “not just as a personal backup of your code, but as a way to play nicely with other developers.“

Noting the benefits when collaborating with other developers, he adds:

Graduating from being the sole architect of your codebase to contributing to a shared codebase is a huge leap for a developer. Perhaps a practical way for people who tend to work on their own to do that would be to submit a pull request or a patch to an open source project or plugin.”

Richard Rutter of Clearleft sees clear advantages for the client, too. He recommends using source control “preferably in some sort of collaborative environment that you can open up or hand over to the client” – a feature found with hosted services such as GitHub.

WEB PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND COLLABORATION USING GITHUB
- January 13, 2014 - by thesambarnes, in Digital Project Management, with 9 comments -

Bio picture of Holly Davis
Holly is a Certified Scrum Master and Agile Project Manager at Award winning web agency White October. We’re currently recruiting a new Project Manager to join the team, feel free to get in touch if you’re interested. You can find Holly on Twitter @ProjectDavis.
A year ago, I had never heard of GitHub and now I’m using it on several of my biggest projects and to my surprise, enjoying doing so!

A cropped version of the GitHub 404 page banner showing it's Octocat character dressed as ObiWan from Star Wars in a desert scene in front of a land speeder and hut.It’s worth using GitHub if only for this each time you type with chubby fingers.
It started just under a year ago when I asked my project team what their preference would be for tracking issues, and the developers were almost evangelical about GitHub. I was aware that most of our active projects were being hosted and deployed from GitHub but didn’t realise it could be used for managing projects too!

So, we took the leap and instead of introducing something new into the mix we started using it to manage tasks, releases and bugs.

The results have far exceeded my expectations, i’ve seen some of the best examples of team collaboration between client, UX, developers, testers and PM, even users have used it to raise bugs or enhancements they’d like to see. This is invaluable for the product owner, who is able to respond to clients directly and add enhancements to the backlog and prioritise accordingly.

Using labels you can create issues for “discussion” i.e. we need a comment system, here are the options giving everyone visibility over the options and the opportunity to comment and be involved with the solution.

A screenshot of low-fi sketches uploaded to GitHubIf I was the client I’d totes sign this off.
GitHub wins on simplicity and its clean interface. Even some of our designers have adopted it for presenting low fidelity sketches to the client / team to review. It’s great to have communication in one centralised place rather than across emails and visible to all the team. You can set up email notifications when people comment or tag you in an issue.

It has also given me more visibility on work in progress. In our daily ODI scrums we have even introduced the reviewing of pull requests. This helps limit work in progress by ensuring pull requests are reviewed, merged and closed. If the same PR is there several days running, it can quickly alert you that something is wrong that you wouldn’t normally be able to pick up on as a non technical PM.

However, like any tool there are a couple of drawbacks. I have had to continue using spreadsheets to track time and velocity over sprints, as you can’t add estimates or track time spent on the issues themselves. However you can assign a milestone to tasks within a sprint which will give you a % indicator of tasks completed but isn’t that helpful if the one task you’ve not completed equates to half the sprint!

Lastly, there is no easy way to prioritise issues. For ODI we’ve added priority 1 and priority 2 tags which work well but i’d like the open issues to work more like a physical backlog where you can click and drag issues to prioritise.

In conclusion, I would recommend using GitHub to other Project Managers, particularly if you’re happy to track project progress outside of GitHub and just embrace it for the ace collaboration tool it is.

A screenshot of the Huboard tool showing a Kanban board.Web project management things in GitHub? Developers, you cannot escape it! :)
If you’re thinking of using GitHub you may want to look at Huboard, a lightweight Kaban board which integrates with GitHub issues.

If that doesn’t fulfil your requirements you may find something that does on this Quora question “Which project management tools are deeply integrated with GitHub?”

Not convinced yet? Why not do some further reading, here are couple of other great blog post on the topic.

Using GitHub issues to manage projects by Z Porter.
Managing projects with GitHub by Jerad Bitner.

Ever since version control systems such as Git have become widely-known and well-used, modern development processes have radically changed.

Here are some reasons why Git has the power to improve your development workflow.


Git Encourages Modularization
In even the smallest development projects, developers are often required to work on multiple components in parallel. Feature X, bug #102, a new UI for a sign-up form, etc.

Among many others, here are a couple of major issues with projects that aren’t version-controlled:

Project dependencies will be painful to manage. Team members must sort out which changes affect which components.
Unfinished and experimental code will mix-in with production-ready code. Without version control, there is a huge chance that an unstable piece of code gets deployed to a production environment.
Imagine these scenarios.

Your client tells you that they don’t want feature X anymore.

Or what if you find that feature Y — an experimental feature you have been working on — can’t be implemented?

How do you get code removed safely from your code base?

Using branches is the solution to these commonplace development problems. Although Git wasn’t the version control system (VCS) that introduced the concept of branching, it’s the first of its kind that makes it user-friendly.

Git Encourages Creativity and Experimentation
Git branching will improve your code-quality and productivity. It facilitates creativity and experimentation by removing your fear that the current version of the project will be affected while you are trying out ideas, giving you an environment where you can confidently explore and develop your project’s future features.

With Git, you can even create multiple branches that approach a given problem in different ways, test each of them with your master branch (the most current version of your project), and then choose the best option.

Git Allows You to Undo Your Mistakes
In Git, you can undo almost everything.

Being able to undo things gives your team the courage to try out ideas and concepts without the risk of breaking stuff, which in turn fosters a culture of innovation.

Git Makes Your Progress Clear
A commit in Git refers to the act of recording changes you have made in your source code.

When used properly, Git makes it easy to craft very granular commits. You can see what changes have occurred down to the microscopic level: Git will tell you what characters and lines in your source code have been altered. If you want to compare two versions of a file or the difference between two of your commits, you can issue Git’s diff command, which will highlight the differences between them.

A side note when using commits: As a good version control policy, I recommend that each commit should only contain changes that belong to a single topic.

For instance, if you’re fixing a specific bug — let’s call it bug #200 — that requires multiple source code changes across several files, all those changes should be under one commit in order for you to easily track changes to your project related to that bug. This way, you can document that "commit X fixed bug #200". A side benefit of this commit policy is, when you encounter another bug similar to bug #200 somewhere else in your project months from now, you can review how you resolved the first bug.

Mixing different topics in one commit makes it hard to see what things were added or resolved.

Also, multi-topic commits makes it more difficult to roll back to a previous version if you ever find the need to do so. Imagine a commit that contains changes for both feature A and feature B. If you find out later on that you introduced a severe security leak with feature B, you’ll have to roll back the code for both topics just to get rid of the problem.

You Can Work Offline
A lot of companies underestimate the benefits that can be had if their developers were to be able to work offline.

Being able to code on your laptop without having to connect to your company’s servers is not only about being able to work during a commute or while at home (which a lot of companies don’t permit due to security restrictions).

More importantly, being able to work offline makes you more fail-safe as a team: While with a VCS like Subversion or CVS, a developer can’t continue their work when a central server goes down, this is not an issue with Git.

In Git, developers can perform everything on their personal computer, making them independent of possible infrastructure downtimes.

Never Lose Data Ever Again
Losing data and not being able to recover it can break a dev project.

We’ve all heard or experienced our own set of horror stories about failed backups and servers. It’s good to know that when using Git, every developer working on a project has a full-fledged copy on their machine, including the project’s complete change history.

And if your team uses a remote source code repository such as GitHub, then the chances of losing your work in the event that your on-site backups fail is much smaller.

If your backups break down, losing data isn’t even a possibility when using Git: Just take any team member’s local repository and restore in minutes.

How to Use Git Today
Git has stepped out of being a technology for early-adopters. Today, more and more developers are using it to improve the quality of their code and workflow.

### Servers

To the extent practical, ensure that software can be deployed on a variety of commodity hardware types

Deploy in a flexible hosting environmentOur services should be deployed on flexible infrastructure, where resources can be provisioned in real time to meet spikes in user demand. Our digital services are crippled when we host them in data centers which market themselves as “cloud hosting” but require us to manage and maintain hardware directly. This outdated practice wastes time, weakens our disaster recovery plans, and results in significantly higher costs.
Resources are provisioned on demand
Resources scale based on real-time user demand
Resources are provisioned through an API
Resources are available in multiple regions
We pay only for the resources we use
Static assets are served through a content delivery network
Application is hosted on commodity hardware
disaster recovery.

Create a stable development environment
There’s little more likely to send a web developer into a wild panic and a client into a wild rage than making a new site live and things just not working. That’s why it’s important to have realistic development and staging environments that mimic the live server as closely as possible.

Are you in the habit of developing new sites right on the client’s server? Or maybe in a subfolder on your local machine? It’s time to reconsider.

Charlie Perrins writes:

Don’t work on a live server – this feels like one of those gear-changing moments for a developer’s growth. Build something that works just as well locally on your own machine as it does on a live server, and capture the differences in the code between the local and live version in a single config file. Ultimately, if you can get all the differences between environments down to a config level then you’ll be in a really good position to automate the deployment process at some point in the future.

Anything that creates a significant difference between the development and the live environments has the potential to cause problems you won’t know about until the site goes live – and at that point the problems are very public and very embarrassing, not to mention unprofessional.

A reasonable solution is to use a tool like MAMP PRO which enables you to set up an individual local website for each project you work on. Importantly, individual sites give you both consistency of paths between development and live, but also the ability to configure server options (like PHP versions and configuration, for example) to match the live site.

Better yet is to use a virtual machine, managed with a tool such as Vagrant. If you’re interested in learning more about that, we have an article on that subject later in the series.

### Testing & Deployment Solutions

A critical capability is being able to automatically test and deploy the service so that new features can be added often and easily put into production.

Keep delivery teams small and focused; limit organizational layers that separate these teams from the business owners

Automate testing and deploymentsToday, developers write automated scripts that can verify thousands of scenarios in minutes and then deploy updated code into production environments multiple times per day. They use automated performance tests which simulate surges in traffic to identify performance bottlenecks. While manual tests and quality assurance is still necessary, automated tests provide consistent and reliable protection against unintentional regressions, and make it possible for developers to confidently release frequent updates to the service.checklist
Create automated tests that verify all user-facing functionality
Create unit and integration tests to verify modules and components
Run tests automatically as part of the build process
Perform deployments automatically with deployment scripts, continuous delivery services, or similar techniques
Conduct load and performance tests at regular intervals, including before public launch

Tim Kadlec is a big proponent of automating your build process:

I’ve been hammering that home to every client I’ve had this year. It’s amazing how many companies don’t really have a formal build/deployment process in place. So many issues on the web (performance, accessibility, etc.) can be greatly improved just by having a layer of automation involved.

For example, graphic editing software spits out ridiculously bloated images. Very frequently, that’s what ends up getting put on a site. If you have a build process, you can have the compression automated and start seeing immediate gains for no effort. On a recent project, they were able to shave around 1.5MB from their site weight simply by automating compression.

Once you have your code in source control, some of that automation can be made easier. Brian Suda writes:

We have a few bash scripts that run on git commit: they compile the less, jslint and remove white-space, basically the 3 Cs, Compress, Concatenate, Combine. This is now part of our workflow without even realising it.

One great way to get started with a build process is to use a tool like Grunt, and a great way to get started with Grunt is to read Chris Coyier’s Grunt for People Who Think Things Like Grunt are Weird and Hard.

Tim reinforces:

Issues like [image compression] — or simple accessibility issues like alt tags on images — should never be able to hit a live server. If you can detect it, you can automate it. And if you can automate it, you can free up time for designers and developers to focus on more challenging — and interesting — problems.

A clear call to arms to tighten up and formalise development and deployment practices. The less that has to be done manually or is susceptible to change, the less that can go wrong when a site is built and deployed. Any procedures that are automated are no longer dependant on a single person’s knowledge, making it easier to build your team or just cope when someone important is out of the office or leaves.

The value of testing with real devices is something Ruth John appreciates. She wrote:

I still have my own small device lab at home, even though I work permanently for a well-established company (which has a LOT of devices at its disposal) – it just means I can get a good overview of how things are looking during development.

### Bug Tracking

### Seating Arrangements

### Analytics & Data
- user data (analytics, user testing tools)
- way to record the number of bugs,
- time tracking
- server deployment and error notifications
- test reporting

And speaking of systems, Mark Norman Francis recommends the use of measuring tools to aid the design process; “[U]se analytics and make decisions from actual data” he suggests, rather than relying totally on intuition.



















## Delivery

- deployment
- fully tested beforehand
- beta period = your warranty period

Continuous Integration makes dev life easier. Happier, better developers and testers. More efficient cycle. Keeps people happy.

Ensure that each project has easy to understand instructions for setting up a local development environment, and that team members can be quickly added or removed from projects


Once you have developed your site, how do you make it live on your web hosting? For many years the answer was to log on to your server and upload the files via FTP. Over time most hosts and FTP clients began to support SFTP, ensuring your files were transmitted over a secure connection. The process of deploying a site however remained the same.

There are issues with deploying a site in this way. You are essentially transferring files one by one to the server without any real management of that transfer. If the transfer fails for some reason, you may end up with a site that is only half updated. It can then be really difficult to work out what hasn’t been replaced or added, especially where you are updating an existing site. If you are updating some third-party software your update may include files that should be removed, but that may not be obvious to you and you risk leaving outdated files littering your file system. Updating using (S)FTP is a fragile process that leaves you open to problems caused by both connectivity and human error. Is there a better way to do this?

You’ll be glad to know that there is. A modern professional deployment workflow should have you moving away from fragile manual file transfers to deployments linked to code committed into source control.

THE BENEFITS OF GOOD PRACTICE
You may never have experienced any major issues while uploading files over FTP, and good FTP clients can help. However, there are other benefits to moving to modern deployment practices.

No surprises when you launch
If you are deploying in the way I suggest in this article you should have no surprises when you launch because the code you committed from your local environment should be the same code you deploy – and to staging if you have a staging server. A missing vital file won’t cause things to start throwing errors on updating the live site.

Being able to work collaboratively
Source control and good deployment practice makes working with your clients and other developers easy. Deploying first to a staging server means you can show your client updates and then push them live. If you subcontract some part of the work, you can give your subcontractor the ability to deploy to staging, leaving you with the final push to launch, once you know you are happy with the work.

Having a proper backup of site files with access to them from anywhere
The process I will outline requires the use of hosted, external source control. This gives you a backup of your latest commit and the ability to clone those files and start working on them from any machine, wherever you are.

Being able to jump back into a site quickly when the client wants a few changes
When doing client work it is common for some work to be handed over, then several months might go by without you needing to update the site. If you don’t have a good process in place, just getting back to work on it may take several hours for what could be only a few hours of work in itself. A solid method for getting your local copy up to date and deploying your changes live can cut that set-up time down to a few minutes.

THE TOOL CHAIN
In the rest of this article I assume that your current practice is to deploy your files over (S)FTP, using an FTP client. You would like to move to a more robust method of deployment, but without blowing apart your workflow and spending all Christmas trying to put it back together again. Therefore I’m selecting the most straightforward tools to get you from A to B.

Source control
Perhaps you already use some kind of source control for your sites. Today that is likely to be Git but you might also use Subversion or Mercurial. If you are not using any source control at all then I would suggest you choose Git, and that is what I will be working with in this article.

When you work with Git, you always have a local repository. This is where your changes are committed. You also have the option to push those changes to a remote repository; for example, GitHub. You may well have come across GitHub as somewhere you can go to download open source code. However, you can also set up private repositories for sites whose code you don’t want to make publicly accessible.

A hosted Git repository gives you somewhere to push your commits to and deploy from, so it’s a crucial part of our tool chain.

A deployment service
Once you have your files pushed to a remote repository, you then need a way to deploy them to your staging environment and live server. This is the job of a deployment service.

This service will connect securely to your hosting, and either automatically (or on the click of a button) transfer files from your Git commit to the hosting server. If files need removing, the service should also do this too, so you can be absolutely sure that your various environments are the same.

Tools to choose from
What follows are not exhaustive lists, but any of these should allow you to deploy your sites without FTP.

HOSTED GIT REPOSITORIES
GitHub
Beanstalk
Bitbucket
STANDALONE DEPLOYMENT TOOLS
Deploy
dploy.io
FTPloy
I’ve listed Beanstalk as a hosted Git repository, though it also includes a bundled deployment tool. Dploy.io is a standalone version of that tool just for deployment. In this tutorial I have chosen two separate services to show how everything fits together, and because you may already be using source control. If you are setting up all of this for the first time then using Beanstalk saves having two accounts – and I can personally recommend them.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
The steps we are going to work through are:

Getting your local site into a local Git repository
Pushing the files to a hosted repository
Connecting a deployment tool to your web hosting
Setting up a deployment
Get your local site into a local Git repository
Download and install Git for your operating system.

Open up a Terminal window and tell Git your name using the following command (use the name you will set up on your hosted repository).

> git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"
Use the next command to give Git your email address. This should be the address that you will use to sign up for your remote repository.

> git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"
Staying in the command line, change to the directory where you keep your site files. If your files are in /Users/rachel/Sites/mynicewebite you would type:

> cd /Users/rachel/Sites/mynicewebsite
The next command tells Git that we want to create a new Git repository here.

> git init
We then add our files:

> git add .
Then commit the files:

> git commit -m “Adding initial files”
The bit in quotes after -m is a message describing what you are doing with this commit. It’s important to add something useful here to remind yourself later why you made the changes included in the commit.

Your local files are now in a Git repository! However, everything should be just the same as before in terms of working on the files or viewing them in a local web server. The only difference is that you can add and commit changes to this local repository.

Want to know more about Git? There are some excellent resources in a range of formats here.

Setting up a hosted Git repository
I’m going to use Atlassian Bitbucket for my first example as they offer a free hosted and private repository.

Create an account on Bitbucket. Then create a new empty repository and give it a name that will identify the repository easily.

Click Getting Started and under Command Line select “I have an existing project”. This will give you a set of instructions to run on the command line. The first instruction is just to change into your working directory as we did before. We then add a remote repository, and run two commands to push everything up to Bitbucket.

cd /path/to/my/repo
git remote add origin https://myuser@bitbucket.org/myname/24ways-tutorial.git
git push -u origin --all 
git push -u origin --tags 
When you run the push command you will be asked for the password that you set for Bitbucket. Having entered that, you should be able to view the files of your site on Bitbucket by selecting the navigation option Source in the sidebar.

You will also be able to see commits. When we initially committed our files locally we added the message “Adding initial files”. If you select Commits from the sidebar you’ll see we have one commit, with the message we set locally. You can imagine how useful this becomes when you can look back and see why you made certain changes to a project that perhaps you haven’t worked on for six months.

Before working on your site locally you should run:

> git pull
in your working directory to make sure you have all of the most up-to-date files. This is especially important if someone else might work on them, or you just use multiple machines.

You then make your changes and add any changed or modified files, for example:

> git add index.php
Commit the change locally:

> git commit -m “updated the homepage”
Then push it to Bitbucket:

> git push origin master
If you want to work on your files on a different computer you clone them using the following command:

> git clone https://myuser@bitbucket.org/myname/24ways-tutorial.git
You then have a copy of your files that is already a Git repository with the Bitbucket repository set up as a remote, so you are all ready to start work.

Connecting a deployment tool to your repository and web hosting
The next step is deploying files. I have chosen to use a deployment tool called Deploy as it has support for Bitbucket. It does have a monthly charge – but offers a free account for open source projects.

Sign up for your account then log in and create your first project. Select Create an empty project. Under Configure Repository Details choose Bitbucket and enter your username and password.

If Deploy can connect, it will show you your list of projects. Select the one you want.

The next screen is Add New Server and here you need to configure the server that you want to deploy to. You might set up more than one server per project. In an ideal world you would deploy to a staging server for your client preview changes and then deploy once everything is signed off. For now I’ll assume you just want to set up your live site.

Give the server a name; I usually use Production for the live web server. Then choose the protocol to connect with. Unless your host really does not support SFTP (which is pretty rare) I would choose that instead of FTP.

You now add the same details your host gave you to log in with your SFTP client, including the username and password. The Path on server should be where your files are on the server. When you log in with an SFTP client and you get put in the directory above public_html then you should just be able to add public_html here.

Once your server is configured you can deploy. Click Deploy now and choose the server you just set up. Then choose the last commit (which will probably be selected for you) and click Preview deployment. You will then get a preview of which files will change if you run the deployment: the files that will be added and any that will be removed. At the very top of that screen you should see the commit message you entered right back when you initially committed your files locally.

If all looks good, run the deployment.

You have taken the first steps to a more consistent and robust way of deploying your websites. It might seem like quite a few steps at first, but you will very soon come to realise how much easier deploying a live site is through this process.

YOUR NEW PROCEDURE STEP BY STEP
Edit your files locally as before, testing them through a web server on your own computer.
Commit your changes to your local Git repository.
Push changes to the remote repository.
Log into the deployment service.
Hit the Deploy now button.
Preview the changes.
Run the deployment and then check your live site.
TAKING IT FURTHER
I have tried to keep things simple in this article because so often, once you start to improve processes, it is easy to get bogged down in all the possible complexities. If you move from deploying with an FTP client to working in the way I have outlined above, you’ve taken a great step forward in creating more robust processes. You can continue to improve your procedures from this point.

Staging servers for client preview
When we added our server we could have added an additional server to use as a staging server for clients to preview their site on. This is a great use of a cheap VPS server, for example. You can set each client up with a subdomain – clientname.yourcompany.com – and this becomes the place where they can view changes before you deploy them.

In that case you might deploy to the staging server, let the client check it out and then go back and deploy the same commit to the live server.

Using Git branches
As you become more familiar with using Git, and especially if you start working with other people, you might need to start developing using branches. You can then have a staging branch that deploys to staging and a production branch that is always a snapshot of what has been pushed to production. This guide from Beanstalk explains how this works.

Automatic deployment to staging
I wouldn’t suggest doing automatic deployment to the live site. It’s worth having someone on hand hitting the button and checking that everything worked nicely. If you have configured a staging server, however, you can set it up to deploy the changes each time a commit is pushed to it.

If you use Bitbucket and Deploy you would create a deployment hook on Bitbucket to post to a URL on Deploy when a push happens to deploy the code. This can save you a few steps when you are just testing out changes. Even if you have made lots of changes to the staging deployment, the commit that you push live will include them all, so you can do that manually once you are happy with how things look in staging.

GET SET UP FOR THE NEW YEAR
I love to start the New Year with a clean slate and improved processes. If you are still wrangling files with FTP then this is one thing you could tick off your list to save you time and energy in 2015. Post to the comments if you have suggestions of tools or ideas for ways to enhance this type of set-up for those who have already taken the first steps.


It's not about the work that you do, but the work you enable others to do.

Smaller teams can afford to keep goals small and finish them often. Then you can test faster and learn quicker. By working quickly you can make decisions quickly, things flow better, and other teams will be envious. Cut your chunks of work into smaller chunks. Keep going to the minimum. If you can see measured improvement then do the rest of the chunks. If not, you've only lost a day or two maximum. Communicating frequently about what you're releasing makes you feel truly agile. Releasing often not only makes the team look good internally, but improves the end result for users too.

THINK HOW, NOT WHAT
Your product isn’t just a bunch of features - so stop focusing on them.

What matters is not what functionality your product has, but how it works. A sign-up process is not just a sign-up process, a checkout process is not just a checkout process, a button is not just a button, a rating system is not just a rating system. Think about how you can stand out by introducing something that everyone else might have but in a unique way - what you are selling at it’s core. Here are a few questions to answer:

What is needed for your product to function well?
How much can you take away from it without sacrificing the core product
Why will people be excited about it
Glasses have one primary purpose, to help you see. Everything on top of that - such as colors, shapes, sizes and logos - is a feature. Understand when you are working on your core product and when you are working on adding features. The benefits of thinking like this, is that it will help you establish a very clear and precise picture of what makes your product your product. This will help you understand the minimal work necessary to get a valuable product out the door, and why you are adding features when you are.

You will be surprised how much the “how” can help improving your product - and getting an MVP out the door.

SHIPPED IS BETTER THAN PERFECT
The goal of sketching, wireframing and prototyping is delivering great product concepts, not great deliverables.

Nobody cares if your deliverables are great if they’re not finished. And few will care how perfect they are even if they are finished. The only people who may marvel at the deliverables are the UX designers, but they’re hopefully too busy to care about internal documentation. On the other hand, everyone wants or absolutely needs you to communicate the right level of details about what they need to do to make a great and feasible solution so they can ship better products, faster.

If you’ve sketched something on scrap paper that you’re confident is a solid solution that everyone can act on immediately, there’s no value in re-creating it in a wireframe or anywhere else. Just take a picture of it and share it where appropriate. In some cases, you may have to quickly replicate it for organizational purposes, but don’t make deliverables for the sake of it - you have better things to do.

When we launched Perch we were, in most cases gently, mocked for writing it in that language everyone loves to hate – PHP. We were quizzed as to why we were not using a trendy NoSQL database. Our technology decisions however, were entirely sensible. They were based on what we knew to be true – that our target customers would not have Python, Ruby on Rails or the latest database available on their cheap hosting. We couldn’t even rely on them to have up to date PHP.

When it comes to launching your own product, it is very tempting to use it as the chance to do all of those things you never get to do in your day job, or on client projects. At last YOU are the client, as a developer there is little more fun than getting to grips with a new technology, building things with the shiniest tools. However, will that serve your customers well? Will they even care, or worse will your latest and greatest languages, tools and techniques actually prevent them from using your product?

PHP isn’t fashionable, a NoSQL database could actually be a great fit for Perch, however if it isn’t available on our target customer’s hosting then there is no point considering it.

The people who will allow you to build a great business around your product are far more invested in your success, because they use your product every day. In our case customers have built their business around selling sites built using Perch. Often they are not developers, but designers and learning a new CMS takes a considerable investment of time. They put a great deal of faith in us, that we won’t turn Perch into something that they can’t use. They trust that we won’t sell out, or otherwise abandon them and we really value that trust.

Understand what people need

We must begin digital projects by exploring and pinpointing the needs of the people who will use the service, and the ways in which the service will fit into their lives. Whether the users are members of the public or government employees, policy makers must include real people in their design process from the very beginning. The needs of people — not constraints of government structures or silos — should drive technical and design decisions. We need to continually test the products we build with real people to keep us honest about what is important.checklist
* Early in the project, spend time with current and prospective users of the service
* Use a range of qualitative and quantitative user research methods to determine people’s goals, needs, and behaviors; be thoughtful about the time spent
* Test prototypes of possible solutions with real people, in the field if possible
* Document the findings about user goals, needs, behaviors, and preferences
* Share findings with the team and agency leadership
* Create a prioritized list of user stories, which are short descriptions of the goals the user is trying to accomplish
* As the digital service is being built, regularly test it with potential users to ensure it will meet peoples’ needs
key questions
    * What user needs will this service address?
    * Why does the user want or need this service?
    * Who are your key users?
    * Which people will have the most difficulty with your service?
    * What research methods were used?
    * What were the key findings from users’ current experience?
    * How were the findings documented? Where can future team members access the documentation?
    * How often are you testing with real people?


Address the whole experience, from start to finishWe must build digital services with an understanding of the range of ways a person might interact with our service, including the actions they take online, through a mobile application, on the phone, or in person. Every encounter should move the user closer towards the desired outcome, whether that encounter is online or offline.checklist
Understand the different points at which people will interact with the service – both online and in person
Identify pain points in the current way users interact with the service, and prioritize these according to user needs
Design the digital parts of the service so that they are integrated with the offline touch points people use to interact with the service
Develop metrics that will measure how well the service is meeting user needs, at each step of the service
key questions
What are the different ways (both online and offline) that people currently accomplish the task the digital service is designed to help with?
Where are user pain points in the current way people accomplish the task?
Where does this specific project fit into the larger way people currently obtain the service being offered?
What metrics will best indicate how well the service is working for its users?

Make it simple and intuitiveUsing a government service shouldn’t be stressful, confusing, or daunting — it’s our job to build services that are simple and intuitive enough that users succeed the first time, unaided.checklist
Create or use an existing, simple, and flexible design style guide for the service
Use the design style guide across related digital services
Provide users with clear information about where they are in the process as they use the service
Follow accessibility best practices to ensure all people can use the service
Provide users with a way to exit and return later to complete the process
Use language that is familiar to the user and is easy to understand
Use language and design consistently throughout the service, including in the online and offline (non-digital) touch points people use to interact with the service
key questions
What primary tasks are the user trying to accomplish?
What is the reading level of the language the service uses?
What languages is your service offered in?
If a user needs help while using the service how do they go about getting it?
How does the service’s design visually relate to other government services?

## Ongoing Maintenance

- security
- performance

Monitor system-level resource utilization in real time
Monitor system performance, measuring response time, latency, throughput, and error rates in real-time
Ensure monitoring in place can measure median, 95th percentile and 98th percentile performance
Create automated alerts based on this monitoring
Track concurrent users in real time, and monitor user behaviors (in the aggregate) to determine how well the service is meeting user needs
Publish metrics internally
Publish metrics externally
Use an experimentation tool that supports multivariate testing in production
key questions
What are the key metrics for the service?
How have these key metrics performed over the life of the service?
What system monitoring tool(s) are in place?
What is the targeted average response time for your service? What percent of requests take more than 1 second, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, and 8 seconds?
What is the average response time and percentile breakdown (percent of requests taking more than 1s, 2s, 4s, and 8s) for your service’s top 10 transactions?
What is your service’s monthly uptime target?
What is your service’s monthly uptime percentage including scheduled maintenance? Excluding scheduled maintenance?
How does your team receive automated alarms when incidents occur?

Digital Projects: When Shit Happens | Digital Project Management | Digital Project Manager | thesambarnes

Margarida Fonseca is a Project Manager at the biggest Portuguese IT company, Portugal Telecom. She is a Certified PMP and has a skill-set spanning several fields, from UX design to digital marketing. You can contact Margarida through LinkedIn.

We’re told that we learn by making mistakes, that there are upsides to making mistakes and thus we should embrace them in order to become wise, but, as a Digital Project Manager, I work incredibly hard to make sure that no mistakes happen on my web projects.

Somehow it’s become a standard that Digital Project Managers must sense and deal with any critical issues that can threaten a project long before it actually happens.

But sometimes, even under the most controlled environments, shit happens.

Sometimes, Digital Project Managers have problems they can’t see.
Something as small as one line of code can significantly impact the direction of a digital project and guess what, that’s exactly what has happened to me on a project I just completed.

The digital project

I was the Content team’s Digital Project Manager for a SharePoint-based website project. This was that kind of project that had the highest level of visibility and exposure within the organization and so great expectations fell on the shoulders of the Digital Project Management team.

After two months of intense design and development, the time had arrived for the Content team to populate the site with copy, images and business apps.
The Development team ran a workshop for the Content team on how to add content to the website and we were all in a big rush to get the work complete.

The Content team really put in a lot of effort to learn how to do this because most of their backgrounds had nothing to do with digital and most were either journalists or designers.

What went wrong?

One week before the big website presentation to the Board, we signed out of SharePoint and tried accessing the website anonymously and uh oh! Something had gone wrong, really wrong! We couldn’t see any content or pages!

The General Project Manager summoned me for a private meeting and I knew this wasn’t going to be good.

Getting called to see the boss when you know it’s not good…
The five-step emotional roller coaster of dealing with shit happening

It turned out that during the workshop, all of the examples and the tutorials delivered to the Content team had the filepaths to the authoring environment defined, so when the Content team went to add everything, without knowing any better, they copied and pasted the filepaths from the tutorials. Eeeek!

During the five minute talk with the General Project Manager, I went through this internal five-step emotional rollercoaster of feelings:

1. I began by taking the Catholic approach to shit happening.

It happened because I’m bad! I blamed myself for what happened, how could I have overlooked such an important detail?

2. I quickly moved to the Calvinist approach to shit happening.

It happened because they didn’t work hard enough! I blamed everyone else for what happened. How did no one notice this? The Development and Content teams should’ve noticed this!

3. Even quicker than the previous stage, I took the guerrilla approach to shit happening.

It did happen and I need to take a hostage! The effort to correct the damage would have to be divided by both teams, Development and Content teams.

4. I then switched to an Einsteinian approach to shit happening.

Thinking that maybe the dimension of it was relative! After all, it would be the second time that they’d be populating the site and thus they’d be much quicker at it this time round.

5. Leading finally to resignation and to a stoic approach to it.

I can take this shit! Break the news to the team as quickly and clearly as possible.

I like to think of this as ‘the five stages of converting digital project shit into digital project fertilizer’

Turning shit into fertilizer

I took a deep breath, made a quick plan of the topics I wanted to address, read them out loud to myself first so I could assert my posture and tone of voice in a positive way (and also to let all of my anger out!)

A photo of a small duckling facing the camera with it's beak open as if shouting.
Let your own anger out. Ironically this picture calms me down.
I needed the team on board and if not motivated, at least focused on the fixing the problem. This was the list of topics I talked to them about on that day:

1. Make it guilt free.

A mistake had been made, explain how the mistake was made and explain to them the extent and impact of it on the whole digital project. Most importantly, it doesn’t matter whose fault it was.

2. Own the solution.

Own the mistake and make them own the solution. It’s up to us to solve this.

3. Give the team time to complain.

Give them time to let it all out and make that moment the only moment of complaining. Then empathize and wrap it up so we can prepare them to kick into action. While in this state of mind, break the message that we have to correct all of it today (it was 5:30 PM when I held the meeting).

4. Be firm about the deadline and make it visual.

Write on the board all the necessary steps and divide the errors into small acheivable tasks. Ask the team to collaborate on the problem solving and adjust when needed. Make sure that everyone knows where and how the error needs to be corrected. We cannot leave today without correcting it and then double checking it.

5. Finish with a bang.

C’mon, let’s roll up our sleeves and show that this can be done on time!

Into the meeting I went…

That meeting that turned out to be a decisive moment on the project. Not only did none of them leave until everyone had finished the job, but they did it perfectly and efficiently – by 9PM the whole website was complete.

The upside to making mistakes

That mistake and its resolution represented a turning point for how I perceived them and how they perceived me. In a twisted way, it was an opportunity for everyone to come together as an organized, determined awesome team.

GO TEAM!
Digital projects are funny like that. Sometimes, when they really go shit, you get through it and come out the other side a stronger person and part of a stronger team.

When the project ended and the teams went their separate ways, they sent me a farewell email thanking me for my balance, calmness and straightforwardness, signed with…
