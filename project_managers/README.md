# Project Managers

_Reading time ~ 45 minutes_

Your role is the most important. Not everyone can handle this role, but given that it touches on every part of the project, it's something that every web professional should try at some point and indeed many have, with Project Managers usually having previously been designers and developers. You are responsible for making sure the rest of the production team can do their jobs smoothly, for making sure the project actually gets produced, and produced to the best of your team's abilities. You are the enabler. 

Most people fall into web project management having previously worked in other roles, most commonly design or development. In some organisations roles are interchanged or rotated so that everyone gets a chance to be a project manager, thus giving everyone a greater commercial and logistical insight into the realities of running web projects, even businesses themselves. I like this idea. Some people will be weaker than others but they can garner support from everybody's shared experience. At the same time, being a project manager, even if only temporarily, adds value from new skills and knowledge, and generates confidence.

Project management is a careful balance of priorities weighted more towards clients, budgets, and schedules, but also concerned with product content, aesthetics, technologies, and performance. Rather than having a small number of things to work on at any one time, there are seemingly countless issues to deal with and numerous key decisions to make on a daily, even hourly, basis.

You're stuck there in the middle of everything, with demands made on you by the client or client manager, your boss, as well as the rest of the production team. They all want different things from you at all times and you have to try and keep them all happy. Of course, you are also making constant demands from all of them, the only difference being that they're probably less understanding as dealing with interruptions isn't as much a part of their job as it is yours. In most cases, when you can be nice and organised any and all interruptions can be scheduled to reduce their impact, but when it's inevitable it helps to share an understanding of the combined pressures of budgeting, scheduling, request handling, and project planning. Thus the rest of the team learn that you have the best overview of the project and gain confidence that your decisions and interruptions are ultimately what's best for the project's success. Afterall, you must be doing something right if you keep delivering successful projects and work keeps coming in.

Unfortunately, as a natural consequence of your large and scattered workload, you can't be expected to always provide perfectly detailed, scoped, and unambiguous briefs and specifications, perfectly accurate costs and timelines, or tease out world-class design work and code. You can't be expected to please everyone all the time. But that of course is the goal and all you can ask for is trust that you're doing your best to work towards it. It's not easy, but hopefully by following some of the advice in this chapter you can be a happier, more productive, and more successful web project manager.

## Success Criteria

In order to perform this role well you'll need experience. In order to gain experience, you'll need to peform this role. However, maybe some other experience can help get you started. More often than not, web project managers have worked previously as designers, developers, account managers, testers, or IT technicians. All web projects are eventually delivered, but whether or not every part of the project is delivered in the best state highlights the value of the web project manager. If the project manager does indeed have a background in another role, it's often the case that that area, be it design or development or whatever, receives more than its fair share of attention. A designer may produce the most stunning UX features, at the expense of blowing the budget on laborious front-end development work. This is where the experience comes in. The longer people cover this role the more accustomed they become to balancing resources while maintaining scope, bugget, timelines, and overall quality. To be truly effective, you need to be able to understand each role; you should embark on your own learning quest to ensure that you yourself can create content matrices, wireframes, UI style guides, JavaScript functions, Test scripts etc.  If you can't then you will be relying on others to make your decisions for you or, worse, representing false expertise to those to whom you're accountable. So, if you're relatively new to this role, then don't worry - it will get easier, and you'll get better, even if you're great already. The way to stay monitor and constantly work on your performance is by being aware of your success measures, or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Your success measures may not be as obvious or easy to assess as those of, for example, a designer - analytics data - or developer - bug reports, analytics data - so we'll cover some ideas here.

The main idea behind KPIs is that they must be measurable metrics. Individual projects may have, indeed should have, their own KPIs to assess the extent to which the post-launch project has achieved it's initial pre-launch goals. The metrics recorded must be specific and consistent in order to allow for objective comparison.

Examples of good project KPIs might be:

* increase conversions by 5%
* reduce time spent by customer service responding to inquiries
* increase subsciptions
* generate 10% more traffic
* improve Google search results position for X keyword

Conversely bad KPIs are vague or difficult, if not impossible, to measure:

* increase brand awareness
* improve usability
* increase time spent on the website

We'll go further into establishing per-project KPIs later.

### Why KPIs are good

At the most basic level, having specific success measures, goals that you are working towards, help to maintain focus on what's important. You may pass on the requirements, make a timeline, meet your deadline, and deliver your project. But that doesn't count as a success if your production team are tired, angry, and resentful and your project of poor quality. This is only going to make your job harder on future projects. Aside from focus, KPIs are valuable in analysing mistakes or failures, allowing you to put measures in place to avoid them in future. If you know exactly what went wrong, you can fix it. 

### Your KPIs

#### Project KPIs

We've cover this more later, but having a set of consistent KPIs for each project, such as a performance budget or analytics targets, allows you to measure and compare on a per-project basis the success of your work. Doing increasingly better at meeting or exceeding project targets shows that you're doing something right. You might want to state an explicit target for each project, e.g. _Meet 100% of project KPIs_

#### Project Goals

Each project proposal should start with some explicit business goals. To what extent these goals have been met can be more difficult to measure and may rely on client feedback. You will certainly want to gather feedback from your client, so liaise with them directly or with your client manager. This KPI is about determining the happiness of the client or project owner. The happier they are, the better you and your team have performed. A concrete example might be: _“Achieve each and every primary and secondary objective”_, or _“Achieve a client satisfaction rating of 90%”_.

#### Timelines & Deadlines

This one is quite straightforward. Did you meet your deadlines? Did everything stay on schedule? E.g.

* _“Meet every deadline”_
* _“Provide agreed deliverables at the end of each week”_
* _“Extend final deadline by no more than 3 days”_

#### Bug Reports

This may not be a reliably comparable metric as each tester will have their own reporting methods, groups of testers may report duplicate issues, and different projects will invariably have different levels of complexity. Still, you may be able to find something you can monitor. How quickly can bugs be closed? How many bugs are reported on average? What kind of bugs are reported? How effective is the reporting? Aside from providing you with useful information to optimise processes, you may be able to extrapolate some information surrounding your team's effectiveness and productivity, which it is your responsibility to optimise.

#### Team Happiness & Productivity

This is exactly the kind of bad KPI mentioned above, being unspecific and seemingly impossible to measure. A major part of your role, however, is keeping your team happy and productive so it would be a good idea to try and find a way to measure the extent of your success (or failure) in this area. Some kind of survey is probably in order, certainly project review meetings, or “post mortems”.

Your ultimate goal in this role is that you'll be able to easily look at a web project and envisage the whole solution in its entirety right rom the start. You'll be able to see clearly what will be involved, be able to easily avoid or mitigate risks, and maintain momentum, until finally seeing through to a successful delivery. You'll understand the precise creative and technical requirements almost as well as any designer or developer. You'll be able to communicate with everyone in a clear and tailored way, speaking in their language such that they are left in no doubt as to the expectations and objectives. You'll keep the team motivated and focused on producing quality work, while shielding them from stress. You'll have no problems producing product plans, schedules, sitemaps, wireframes, and functional specifications that your production team can work from with ease.

## The Right Mindset

You control chaos with a strong determined smile and a tenacious attitude that means stuff can get done. You're also squeezed in the middle of various departments and levels of seniority, being pulled in different directions, into different environments, despite everyone working towards the same goal - the project being delivered successfully. So yeah... it's stressful... but it can also reward you with the greatest sense of accomplishment as you know more than anyone how much work has gone into putting the project together. Many people fail to appreciate just how many hats you have to wear or what skill it takes to accomplish your role, yet they all look to you to be the fountain of knowledge, to give them direction, help resolve problems, and be the steady rock while everyone else crumbles.

So how are you supposed you cope? It begins with honesty, trust, and integrity. No matter what you must stay calm and give everyone the cold hard facts throughout the lifecycle of each project. This will cement your position as a leader and will earn you respect from both the client or client manager as well as the rest of the production team. An environment of mutual respect is one that is much more condusive to a productive team and a truly excellent end product. There are many points in a project when you feel you may have to withhold or sugarcoat the truth. For example, explaining why a deliverable is late, telling a team member their work isn't up to scratch, or admitting that you yourself made a mistake. This will only serve to damage your relationships in the long-run, and your role is nothing if not dependent on solid relationships. It's always obvious when people are being false or obfuscatory. Telling the truth may hurt in the short term but it will help you build stronger relationships in the longterm. Once the client gets over their anger about the late delivery, they will at least know you have the courage to tell them bad news and will be more likely to trust what you tell them going forward. This is especially valuable for long-running projects.

Similarly integrity can be displayed by admitting responsibility for a mistake that you or a team member made, openly defending a client or team member, or insisting on maintaining quality standards, despite the pressure of looming deadlines. Having the fortitude to take the flak from angry clients isn't easy, adding an unneeded and undeserved surplus to your existing stress levels, but it will earn you reputation points. If on the other hand you fail to act with honesty and integrity as a project manager then eventually those you work with will wise up and start to treat you with mistrust, which will be incredibly damaging to all your projects.

Project managers all too often get the blame. Designers and developers may think they always agree to any and all client requests, no matter how preposterous, and just filter them down to those doing the real work, by which point it's too late to say no. Unfortunately, this blame is sometimes deserved. A big part of your job, and part of being honest and having integrity is standing up to the clients or client managers and rejecting requests if they are going to be too difficult, out of scope, or jeopardise other parts of the project delivery. They are paying you to advise them, to tell them the cold hard facts, to protect them from poor decisions, even if it's not what they were hoping to hear. Situations when project managers might yield to such requests are when they don't have enough knowledge, experience, or confidence to challenge the request and suggest an alternative, or when they are simply feeling lazy. As a project manager you need to ensure you equip yourself with knowledge, experience, confidence, and motivation, exactly for situations like this. If you don't have the knowledge, admit this to your team; it's ok to not know about something as long as you're willing to learn, and maybe another team member could step in and fill your knowledge gap. If on the other hand it's a courage or confidence issue then fear not, for this is completely normal. To overcome that fear, practice your reasoning with other team members first to reinforce your decisions. Remember that part of your role is to provide expert consultation to the client while showing loyalty and dedication to your team. 

Sometimes, you will fail. There will be times when, perhaps due to circumstances beyond your control, you will have to accept bad requests and deliver them to your team. As with any other team-based role, one of the most important skills is empathy. First understand the request is going to piss people off; they are going to be resentful when they work on it. Also understand that this anger and resentment is a strong emotional reaction that means they actually care about what they do, which is a very good sign - they're not just being difficult. It's better to have a designer or developer angry about something with good cause than completely indifferent to everything, delivering as much or as little as required like a mindless automaton, incapable of innovation and passion, creating lacklustre project work. Recognise your team's frustration as passion and embrace it.

Earlier we mentioned mutual respect. When delivering work requests to your team, whether deemed good or bad, you need to offer an explanation along with it. Why we need to carry out this request, why you're assigning them, what your expectations are. No explanation and it's as if you're implying they don't care, can't understand, or that their opinions on the matter are not worth anything. Web designers and developers are highly skilled and intelligent people that will definitely understand, and want to understand, the background behind each request. If a request might at first appear a trifle waste of their time, then taking the time to explain your decision on why you've accepted the request may work to turn an atmosphere of resistance and frustration into one of acceptance and motivation. If you explain the history of the decision along with the rationale, then the same clever people you're asking to execute the request will hopefully realise that they too would make the same decision in your shoes.

Honesty, integrity, trust, empathy - the character traits of a great web project manager.

### Staying Positive

This is good general life advice. If you stay positive during a challenging time then it's more likely to yield a positive result. Conversely if you take a negative viewpoint then the chances of failure are maximised. This lesson is often misunderstood or abused in the workplace, resulting in short-term failure. Imagine a situation where a client makes a huge change request or imposes on you an unreasonable deadline, or where your production team entirely fail to deliver something promised. If you don't offer unconditional agreement, positive feedback or calm reassurance, then you may be labelled as being negative.

But maybe you are being negative. Maybe what's being asked of you and your team is actually feasible? Maybe you're dooming the challenge to failure before you've even tried? Part of your job is sometimes to provide negation, refusal, or denial, but always to avoid lacking positivity, lacking constructive criticism, or being miserable, gloomy, and unpleasant. We've all encountered negative people in this industry. There are those who are never positive about any project or strategy, and there are those who often come across as negative but are just being realistic and bravely speaking up while still pushing forward with the work. We're aiming to be the second type, of course. It's actually better to point out problems with ideas rather than always just trying to be blindly positive about everything, like some hipster valley entrpreneur who's already adopted the mentality that simply being positive means they will surely prevail. Sure, this mentality is infectious and makes for a much nicer, more motivational work environment. But being positive about everything can be dellusional - if everything is great then nothing needs to be fixed or improved. Sometimes you're just going to have to shit on people's _positive_ suggestions and requests with cold hard facts. There's not enough time, or money, or what they're asking can't be done, or it's really not a good idea because... etc. So by all means try and stay generally positive, but be prepared to be negative. How you handle your negativity situations will make or break you as a project manager though - either people will gradually resent you or come to respect your judgement. You can only learn through your mistakes so just keep making them and move forward.

### Being Nicely Negative

> A negative person is rarely positive, a realistic person is sometimes positive and sometimes not, but when not, always tries to get things into a state where they can feel positive about it as opposed to constantly ‘thinking positive’ and screwing up time and time again. Being realistic does not mean limiting your dreams; it simply means you make sensible steps to reaching them.

> -_Sam Barnes_

When it comes to disagreeing with people or expressing your concerns, never assume that they have the same level of understanding as you do. A client's request may seem so phenominally unreasonable to you that you may want to simply spontaneously combust and be done with it all. It's obviously not that unreasonable to them otherwise they wouldn't have asked, would they?

Remember that as the project manager you have the widest field of view over the entire project. You know your team and their capabilities. You know what they're working on, what they need to be productive, what their limits are. You know the project, what features it entails, when everything has to be completed by and what's needed to bring each part to completion. It comes back to empathy - you need to put yourself in their shoes and understand where their request or comment is coming from. Then you need to take some time out to think before you respond. Collect your thoughts, your knowledge, and experience, and determine whether the request is actually reasonable or the comment justified. Maybe your instincts are wrong on this one. You have the facts to hand so approach the problem calmy and logically and use them to justify your response. Take the problem, break it down into smaller chunks, and assess the time, money, and people situation to determine the path of least resistance. If you still can't find a way to make it work, after sincerely trying, then you have good reasoning to go back with. Once you have these cold hard facts then even those of the sunniest disposition won't be able to refute them.

But you're still at risk of coming across as a negative nancy. If you really disagree with something then it's not worth wasting time complaining about it unless you're willing to try and fix it or offer a reasonable solution. Part of your role is to solve problems just as much as it is the designer and developers'. Always follow up your dream-crushing facts with either a proposed solution or a forum where a solution can be derived, such as a meeting. Maybe you can find a spare resource, adopt some clever workarounds, get more money, or reframe the problem. Find a way to get positive about it again.

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls

Preparing for the worst should put you in a good position to deal with problems when they inevitably arise. Some projects seem endless, you often don't have enough resources, technical systems and tools break down, people get sick, clients or bosses try to micromanage, and sooner or later everything turns into a disaster. Web projects are confusing. The most common pitfall lies in miscommunication that serves to add to that confusion.

Never assume that you know better than the client or that you understand the pressures that they too are under. They may have superiors to report to or a team of stakeholders to juggle. Add to that they probably don't have as much experience as you with working on the web. While some of their requests may seem ridiculous to you, they are entirely serious. You have to resist the temptation to be condescending or patronising in any way but rather remain polite and helpful. Frame your replies to such a request in terms of previously agreed steps in the process, highlighting the tasks that you and your team are currently working on and how you will aim towards achieving the underlying goal behind the request. Coming back with useful and reassuring information not only satisfies the client but also provides them with something to go back to their own team with. 

Avoid using jargon. Always consider who you're speaking to and how best to communicate your message to them in their terms, without being patronising of course.

Don't submit to envy when you see others leaving work earlier than you or arriving later. There will inevitably be times when they are busier than you. You have the benefit of seeing an end to every project, you get recognition for successful deliveries, and you have clear success criteria, known targets, which perhaps others don't. It may seem like the client manager's job is to promise clients that which you have to deliver without even a clear idea if it's even possible, but in fact part of their job is to convince the client to go with your team, and at your costs, no matter what. Your plan is fixed and certain, based on specific tasks and goals, while those of others may not be. Always consider the situation others are in and try to cut them a little slack now and again. Never criticise unduly and when you do, make it constructive by offering helpful advice and trying to find a common ground. The alternative is to jeopardise relationships that you rely on and ultimately contribute to your already towering mountain of stress.

Resign yourself to the fact that there is a fixed, maybe even reduced budget. Also resign yourself to the fact that scope likely isn't fixed and is sooner to be expanded than reduced. Great! Unfortunately, this is just something you'll have to accept and move on. No point crying over spilt milk, as the saying goes. A truly great project manager will find a way to maximise the resources at hand to produce the optimum result, and that is the quintessential challenge of your role.

There are various tools and methods for dealing with this challenge. Primarily among them is by building a great team and cultivating relationships such that everyone helps eachother and works efficiently. Easy right? pfft. An easy way to give yourself some leeway is to always overestimate the time and money required. Overspend the budget, place deadlines beyond a date by which you know delivery is achievable. You may need to justify this on the basis that future projects for the same project owner will allow them to reclaim the overspend for the current one.

> Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge: Look, Mr. Scott, I'd love to explain everything to you, but the Captain wants this spectrographic analysis done by 1300 hours.

> Scotty: Do you mind a little advice? Starfleet captains are like children. They want everything right now and they want it their way. But the secret is to give them only what they need, not what they want.

> Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge: Yeah, well, I told the Captain I'd have this analysis done in an hour.

> Scotty: How long will it really take?

> Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge: An hour!

> Scotty: Oh, you didn't tell him how long it would *really* take, did ya?

> Lt. Commander Geordi La Forge: Well, of course I did.

> Scotty: Oh, laddie. You've got a lot to learn if you want people to think of you as a miracle worker.

Alternatively you can work to lower budgets than you actually have in order to cater in advance for the inevitable overrun. The best case is you deliver under budget and attain some internal process skills, and the worst case is that you deliver on budget. Either way, the project owner is going to be very happy and think you're a miracle worker. You may find pushback from your team, however, so you'll need to convince them of the Pareto Principle - that 80% of the project outcome is realised by only 20% of the work put in. If they can work more efficiently, making that 20% great, then maybe the rest isn't as important, so long as the client is satisfied. Much of that 80% is made up of review cycles and unplanned iterations.

However you decide to plan your project, make sure you involve your team from the start with open communication. Decide together how to share out laborious tasks, who can help who with what. You'll also need to keep your hands dirty throughout the project lifecycle. Get your hands dirty in the code, the copy, the images. Familiarise yourself with the strain of the boring and repetitive tasks. Understand the work and what you're asking of your team. Encourage everyone to divide their labour and share what they've learned. They should focus on high-concentration tasks for only an hour at a time, and review each other's work. Equip every project with tools and techniques than can be re-used along the way. Do your best to make it a team effort.

> It is a platitude that any kind of management only has two ways to get anything done – action and communication. Communication without action is simply pretending, and action without communication will never lead anywhere. Big gestures, speeches, or any other kind of ‘pep talk’ are not really well suited for motivating people’s participation without follow through.

> _- Michael Dlugosch_

It's all too easy to fall into narcism as a web project manager. We have so much to do. Our work is so important - without what we do everything else falls apart. We don't have time to keep people happy, we just need to get our work done and keep everything running as smoothly as possible both for the sake of the project... and, let's face it, our own comfort. We crave the reputation, the recognition, the status in the team. However if that's our primary concern then it will negatively impact the team's motivation for go the extra mile for us. A project manager must manage, and that means to lead, and to lead is to take action.

> Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.

> _- Master Yoda_

The most common pitfall is fear, and as Yoda said, it does indeed lead to anger and suffering. At the start of every project you know that things will go wrong. You'll struggle to meat a deadline, you'll have to deal with difficult client requests, even an unresponsive client, or your best developer may fall ill or go on holiday. Knowing this inevitability and still being unprepared for it is the web project manager's cardinal sin. You need to stay calm and anticipate how you're going to handle the situation. A good start is planning and documentation. Documenting everything, including communication, and having written contingencies in place will put everyone at ease when the time comes. An unreasonable demand doesn’t get any better, regardless of how often you repeat it. If the client or client manager is adamant about a particular request or feature that is beyond the agreed scope, then you must comprehensively document the interdependencies involved. Break the problem down into individual tasks. What is required for each task? Who will do the work? What will that require of other team members? What will the deliverables be? How long will it take? etc. This documentation will not only make implementation easier and put everyone on the same page, but will also be good to take back to the client to justify a spending increase or deadline delays.

Try and avoid any and all assumptions as much as possible. Using a particular tool or framework will not necessarily alleviate problems or reduce the time required, you can't rely on the developer to fix all reported bugs in a fixed time period before you know exactly what the bugs are. Try and identify all the likely points of failure well in advance. Most importantly, when things do go wrong, stay calm, stay polite, don't throw blame around, just find the best way to resolve the situation.

Going back to pre-emptively anticipating fear-inducing situations, one you'll surely have for at least one project during your time as a web project manager, if not every project, is resourcing issues. The client will expect you to be flexible enough to accommodate their delays in delivering materials or feedback without impacting final deadlines. You will be expected to allocate people to project work despite not having a clear grasp of the scope, and in the face of a slipping deadline and a shrinking budget. You must, however, **never** admit or even complain to anyone about not having enough resources. It will only serve to annoy your team, your client manager, your boss, the client, damaging relationships that you rely on. Furthermore, it's probably not entirely true even if you don't realise it. Unfortunately, it's usually your concern and nobody else's. The client certainly doesn't need to hear it - you don't expect to go into a restaurant as a customer, place your order, and then be told the chef can't cook your meal because they don't have the time or the ingredients. Instead you might be told that something is off the menu or that it will take time to prepare. You might change your order, you might go to another restaurant, or you might wait patiently and enjoy the meal that you are served.

There are some techniques you can employ to deal with resourcing issues when your team is stretched beyond its capability. Essentially though what they come down to is just buying time and accurately prioritising individual tasks. Luckily, as a project manager that's what you're best at. Never confirm or commit to anything until you've thoroughly checked it against budget and schedules. When new requests come in, they may actually improve on the agreed functionality or feature set to the point that they're really worth trying for the sake of the project's success, no matter the strain it will put you under. On the other hand if you can put a case for the increased time and money required the project owner may reconsider and deem it not worth it before withdrawing the request. You could try squeezing the requested work into the existing schedule, which would mean asking your team to work overtime in return for some promised compensation. Or you could just assign it to one person who you deem fit for the job, the hero who has to “take one for the team”. Alternatively you could rely on the advice and ingenuity of your team of experts. Make the task description as clear as possible and involve them in resolving the matter. Maybe there are other tasks that can be shuffled around, postponed, or better distributed. It's also important to consider what the task involves and therefore who would be capable of taking it on. Is it a specialist job or might you yourself be able to dip your hands in? Even if you're not entirely up to the task you may be able to seek help from a team member, learning something along the way and impressing them with your altruism. Or otherwise maybe everybody can chip in a little of their time so that everyone shares the load.

## Getting things done

> This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember: all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more.

> -_Morpheus_

You arrive at the office at 0930 with your day fully planned out. You finish your caffeinated beverage, catch up on a few articles, and prepare to start work. It's 0950 and you've already received 10 e-mails, the client manager has been lingering around your desk, and you have a team of designers and developers waiting for your briefing before you can start work, all of which demands presidence over your scheduled work. Should have taken the blue pill.

One of the biggest challenges of project management is learning how to deal with several trillion things each day, approximately. Gone are the days of sitting down with a code editor and spending a day quietly tapping out some new algorithms, or playing around with typefaces on a blank canvas until you have that smug feeling of visual satisfaction. Every project is different. Every team is different. Yet somehow you have to stay on top of everything and maintain the steady pace of progress, like the burly drummer at the front of a dragon boat struggling through choppy waters.

One approach to this daunting challenge was conceived by David Allen and is accompanied by the tagline “The Art of Stress Free Productivity”. It probably won't leave you stress free - you're still a project manager and stress is par for the course - but you will certainly be more organised and equipped to deal with your gargantuan task list after adopting this system. While we're not going to cover the system in detail here - you may want to go get the book for that - we can at least go into a few points that are useful for web project managers specifically.

The main idea is to break down tasks into their smallest possible units, then organise and categorise them as “next actions” or “waiting for” items. This will help ensure you never forget to complete a task no matter how many other things you have to action, how long it's been since you last thought about it, or how small it is to other issues at hand. Everyone will want to spend time getting used to implementing this system and tweak it to their own ends. You'll need a tool like Gmail, Things, Evernote, or something capable of recording and categorising notes and tasks - devise your own system to do the following:

* Scan through all your emails at the start of the day. Anything that requires you to do something, mark it as a TODO (i.e. “next action”) and drag it to a TODO folder. 
* Anything that does not require an action should be read and archived into a project folder.
* If an e-mail contains something that requires you to wait for something from someone else before you can action it then categorise it as “waiting” and drag it to a WAITING folder.
* If an email contains something that you were waiting for, then immediately edit the corresponding item in the WAITING folder and then move it to the TODO folder.
* If an email can be replied to quickly and easily and will help someone else out or help move the project forward, then it's minimal effort from you so just reply immediately and instinctively, then archive it into the appropriate project folder, or if you need to wait for a reply then move it to the WAITING folder.


After doing this, you should have reached the fabled "inbox zero". Having an empty e-mail box does wonders for your stress levels, offering releif and a very real sense of accomplishment. Go get yourself another caffeinated beverage as a reward.

Now what?

Now you should go through your TODO list and prioritise them. The first item on your list each day should be the team briefing or daily standup meeting. We'll get to that later. Next thing is to go through your WAITING list to see if you need to send any reminders to anyone that they may be able to work on during the course of the day, allowing you to move the action to your TODO list as soon as possible. All that's left for the day is to go through your TODO list. If you get so many emails every day that you can't deal with them as they come in, or such that it would take too long to organise all your tasks within the first half hour of your day, then you may want to regroup in the afternoon and spend some more time going through your lists. List-making is the project manager's forté.

### Dealing with Interruptions

The client may call out of the blue, the client manager may still be lingering around your desk or bouldering over every 10 minutes. Your production team may be throwing questions at you left right and centre. Meanwhile, your eye keeps flicking towards your enormous TODO list. Stay calm.

There are two things to do here. First is to have your handy lists on handy. Make a mental note of where you're at in what you're doing, stop, and give your time and full concentration to whoever is requesting it. Not only is it your job, but everyone will like you for it and be more understanding when you make demands on their precious time. With your lists at the ready, any actions that come up during your conversation can be put straight on the TODO list. At the end of the conversation why not take advantage of the situation and check through your WAITING list to see if there's anything this person can help you with? Maybe you can close off some issues that can help the project move forward. This will also clearly demonstrate to whoever you're dealing with that you are on top of the situation, giving them confidence in your project management capabilities.

### What You Need

#### Clear & Realistic Specifications

You've received the project specifications from the client or the client manager and you're starting to break it down into tasks and phases. It'll inevitably start to dawn on you that the deliverables are too ambiguous or that there doesn't seem to be enough time or budget or available skills to deliver the project successfully. Right now you're the only one that knows this and you get a lump in your throat. You're going to have to let the client know. Your immediate instinct is to push back or try to redefine the project scope. This is going to lose you some valuable trust points and give the client a negative impression of you right from the start.

You're going to need to try and resolve the situation and establish a project scope that you can confidently deliver. In other words, don't bitch and moan about it, but rather try one of the following to ensure you always get specifications that you can work with:

* Ensure that you are always involved in the pre-sales process
* Explain clearly and honestly the difficulty that the current scope puts you and your team in
* Meticulously track time spent on each project phase that the sales team or client manager can use as a reference in future
* Involve the client manager throughout the project lifecycle to help them gain an understanding of what's involved

If you have any problems with the project specifications, raise it with the relevant people early and in a professional manner, and try to suggest solutions. A really great specification should allow you and your team to under sell and over deliver.

#### Adequate Time

Aside from how long the project itself will take is how long it will take you to manage it. Unfortunately, this is almost impossible to estimate and only gets easier with experience. Ideally you'll only be managing one project at a time but it may be the case that you have to handle multiple projects. This may be achieveable as long as your multiple projects are all staggered at different phases. Don't start more than one project at the same time.

Most importantly, if at any stage you feel you don't have enough time to adequately manage your workload, raise it immediately. You are at risk of losing control of the project, which will only serve to increase your workload and stress levels, and you will inevitably take the brunt of the blame if the project fails to be a success.

As with web designers and developers, if we have enough time to do our jobs properly web project managers feel more confident of delivering high quality projects and that’s what makes us happy.

#### Trust and Confidence

As we discussed above, trust from the client, the client manager, your boss, and every member of the production team is crucial. You are on the front-lines, making critical decisions on a daily basis. The success or failure of the entire project largely falls on your shoulders and yet your job relies on so many uncontrollable factors. Good project management doesn't necessarily lead to project success, but bad project management always leads to project failure. Trust can only be gained and isn't given blindly. You gain it by demonstrating that you can do your job effectively, take control, and always, always accept responsibility.

#### A Capable Production Team

In your role you simply don't have the time to do everything yourself, or even to help out with content, design, development and testing, on top of everything else. You need to be able to confidently delegate tasks and know that they will be completed to your standards of quality, and also resist the temptation to even think that something would have been done better if you'd just done it yourself. Relying on the skills of your team is essential and so that means not just hiring well but also maintaining and developing skills - the better your team gets the easier your job becomes and the better your products are.

You should absolutely be involved in the hiring process. If you're not, start kicking and screaming until you are. Nobody knows better than you what skillsets your team may be lacking and what are in surplus, nor is anyone else in a better position to assess how well a candidate will fit into your team. Chances are you've done design or development work previously so you can accurately assess candidates' breadth and depth of knowledge. You can find more useful advice about hiring & firing in _Chapter 3 - Production Directors_. Remember though, as we talked about previously, not to be resource greedy. Perhaps you don't need to hire someone new if an existing team member can be trained up.

Each web project is different so you'll need to establish early on which skillsets you'll require to pull it off and match that up with what you have available in order to identify any potential gaps. Maybe you're a freelancer or a small agency where you yourself cover many roles. At the very least specialist jobs require specialist skills and may require dedicated experts, i.e. content people, design people, development people, testing people etc., to handle them. Within in each specialist area may be more precise specialisations to consider. A design role may need to cover complex animation, image manipulation, or video production for instance. A development role may necessitate experience with particular languages or frameworks. Your project will have a much greater chance of success of you have the luxury of putting together the right team.

> Developers often treat PM as The Source of All Evil. And to some point they’re right. It’s a project manager who brings more work. It’s a project manager who bugs everyone asking when they’re going to be done.

> _- Pawel Brodzinski_

You have to expect a lot of support from your team, but that means you have to provide it as well. An atmosphere of mutual support is what you're going for here - if you scratch their backs they'll scratch yours. The support you provide may come in many forms. After you delegate tasks, always make yourself available to answer questions and provide encouragement. Never just dump a load of work on someone and disappear. Sometimes, get them started yourself if you can. A few lines of code, some basic wireframes, or some lines of copy may go a long way to show humility, that you're not above the work of others. In doing so you're setting an example and might even learn something if they can provide feedback on your work, leading to a better mutual understanding. As with clients or directors who like to micromanage, my advise is to leave it to the experts and those whose role is there specifically for completing such tasks. You need to respect and actively seek their skills, knowledge, and advice.
 
Thank them and recognise their efforts publicly, but always offer your own criticism and advice privately. Even if they are performing well, it's your job to push them to always be better. Constantly encourage them to learn new tools and techniques, give them the time for training to practice what they've learned. Of course, you need to take this into account when formulating schedules and conjuring deadlines. It will pay off in the long run as they learn to work more efficiently and can accommodate a greater variety of requests. That means fewer bottlenecks for you.

Ultimately, no matter whether you always manage to hire industry wizards or not, your team will only ever be as productive are you enable them to be, which leads us nicely onto the next section.

#### Suitable Tools

You're going to have a lot on your plate so you should make use of the myriad of tools available to make your work more efficient. We're not going to recommend any specific ones here but if it's your first day on the job then you're going to want to set yourself up with some or all of the following:

* A easy to use task planner that syncs across all your devices
* A note taking tool that syncs across all your devices
* A timeline tool
* A project planner, e.g. a kanban board or gant chart
* Somewhere to store important details about each project
* A shared calendar
* A shared chatroom
* A code editor
* Whatever software you need to open design documents

Use whatever you're most comfortable with, beit a notebook and a whiteboard or one of these all-encompassing bells-and-whistles SaaS platforms of which there are many many paid and open-source options. Having a physical kanban board is a great idea because it's easily visible and accessible to the production team, but bear in mind that most of your work will need to be easily documented and shared.

## Facilitating Others

Your role basically covers the following:

* requirements analysis
* scheduling
* budgeting
* task delegation
* monitoring & reviews
* documentation
* training

Let's pigeonhole your production team into content managers, designers, developers, and testers. They are all highly skilled experts with very specific remits. You need to keep them focused on what they are there do, which is hopefully also what they do best and what they enjoy most. Nothing will destroy their passion, productivity, and morale quicker than having them involved in other parts of the project beyond those remits. For example, asking a developer to do content population, or asking a designer to write headlines, or indeed asking anyone to fill out timesheets...

### Keeping them focused

Of course there are times when everyone is going to have to do minor tasks in support of project management. Yes, timesheets, but also planning meetings, their own internal schedules, answering phone calls and emails etc. You have to do everything you can to minimise the impact of such tasks so that they don't cause people to get sidetracked such that quality is reduced and the project momentum is dampened. Even if just one person is suffering more than others under the weight of unread emails, the effectiveness of the entire team is affected.

So how can you help? Be a stress sponge. Back to the e-mail example, ensure you are copied in on all project-related e-mails. Yep, all of them. That way you have an eye on to whom issues are being directed and can step in if needs be. By reducing their stress, they work better, which means that eventually you have less to be stressed about. So the stress dividends pay off later.

> It should be assumed that part of the role is to basically take crap on behalf of your team in such a way that they don’t even get a whiff of it, even if they’re the cause of it. Your job is to keep your team positive, motivated and focussed on their job – and if this means taking some crap you know you don’t deserve then so be it.

> _- Sam Barnes_

You also need to shield your team from information that they personally don't need to worry about. In the same way, your boss isn't troubling you with the organisation's overall financial situation, the office space rent, employee health cover, taxes etc. Anything client-related, for instance, can stay between you and the client manager. Anything code-related can filter down to the developer. Sam Barnes' crap analogy is an excellent one. He goes on to note that if you can't take the crap then you have no place in any management role. So when e-mails come your way containing issues that you may need to seek help on, first try to identify the core problem or question - you may need to translate or simplify the message to make it easier for the recipient. Never just forward emails or specifications. This is expecially true of bug reports - chances are the client's language will appear commical at best to any developer, and confusing at worst. If you can identify the bug yourself, write the report more accurately and concisely, and go on to provide accomanying screenshots, then your developer will be able to dive right in. Better yet, if you can identify the cause of the bug yourself then you not only help them out considerably but you may also learn something new or maintain your own skills.

Never mislabel an issue as urgent unless it really, really is. Again, you should try and absorb the stress as much as possible. If something can possibly wait, and the chances are it probably can, then let it wait until the end of an interation or sprint or at least a suitable gap in the work. If something really is urgent, then do everything you can to reduce its impact - put more people on it or try and step in to help with it yourself. Especially don't label something as urgent just because it will help with your own scheduling - that's transferring your stress onto others.

Consider when it's appropriate to disturb people. Get to know your team, when they are most productive and when they might be able to handle short interruptions. Limit scheduling meetings to the start of the day and never drag someone into a meeting where they are not required for the entire duration. Arranging group meetings, such as daily standups, can be a great way for every to quickly provide everyone else with an update on their status. If in part of a meeting you find there are one or two small things you need someone for, take a note and get back to whoever's asking once you have the answer later. Again, if it's something small then wait until that person is on a break or clearly available to talk.

Lastly, if it looks like someone is approaching burnout or is doing too much overtime, give them a break. Even in the face of looming deadlines and everyone is under pressure, it's better that you take the flak yourself from your client or boss. Tired and stressed team members do not produce their best work, which will in the end be detrimental to the product. Reaching actual burnout will just mean a longer recovery time before they can be productive again, further impacting the project. As Sam Barnes said, you just have to take the crap yourself.

### Be a team player

Put yourself on the same level, and never consider yourself in charge or in any way perched on a pedestal somewhere above the other team members.

Be humble, and willing to forgo the glory and recognition for your efforts. Johnny Ive may get the credit for Apple's impeccable product design, but he has a team of 80,000 people working behind the scenes at California all focused on making Apple products the best they can be. Let the star designers and devlopers and developers have their glory, let praise be adorned over the beauty and the functionality, but remain smug in the knowledge that if you weren't there everything would completely fall apart. If you have a team of 10 people, then feel those 10 pats on your back. 

Stand up for your team members. Be willing to push back on clients, your boss, or other teams if more time is needed or if requests simply can't be met. And always defend them to your bosses, even if they have made mistakes; never blame them for anything. Any mistakes or failures are always those of the team and it's your job to find a mitigating solution.

### Give them what they need

Exactly what they need. Nothing more, nothing less. At the start of each project spend as much time as you need pouring through the specs and requirements, filtering, summarising, and categorising:

#### Content Managers

* What is or should be the tone of the organisation? What should their voice sound like if they were a person? What is their industry and who are their competitors?
* Who will be providing the copy? Us? Them? Who will be maintaining it going forward and what tools might they need to do so?
* What is the content breakdown? Blog posts? Product listings? etc. Are there any potential rich data models?
* What is the rough scale of the content? How many posts or product listings? etc.
* Who is the target demographic?
* How/when/where will the content be consumed? What is the nature of the web project?
* What languages will be supported?
* What are the accessibility requirements?
* What are the target keywords?
* What format should copy be supplied in?
* Is a CMS required? What content types should be static and which dynamic?

#### Designers

* What is the theme of the organisation? Brand colours, typefaces, brand style guide etc.
* Who is the target demographic?
* What are the supported platforms for the web project? What are the performance considerations?
* What are the client's personal style preferences?
* What is the tone of the content being presented?
* Who will provide imagery or what are the guidelines around imagery?

#### Developers

* What are the supported platforms and devices?
* What is the required functionality?
* What is the performance budget?
* Is a content management system required? How much dynamic content will there be?
* Will any data be drawn from external sources?

#### Testers

* What are the supported platforms for the web project?
* What is the performance budget?
* What is the UI style guide?

#### Everyone

* What's the deadline?!?

You'll note that of the requirements listed above, the content managers will need the most up-front, because their work will be the bulk of the beginning phase of the project. Content first, remember. Following that is the designers' requirements, followed by the developers' and testers'. That is because design is to some extent dependent on content, and development is similarly dependent on design, while testing is of course dependent on everything. That is not to say though they they are not all interdependent, nor that they should be executed independently in a waterfall model, but we'll get to that later.

What we've covered so far in this section is by no means exhaustive and indeed every team or web professional may have their own individual requirements. What's important is that you take the information you have, identify and investigate any gaps, and tease out specifically what you need to share with who. Even after you've reviewed the details of a new project yourself, approach each team member or team lead individually and find out what else they might need. There will be items on which you will need their feedback in order to formulate your budgets and schedules. Only once everyone has all the required information at hand, or at least as much as can possibly be provided, are you ready to kick off and deliver your plan.

### Adaptive communication

You need to be able to communicate with everyone involved in the project **on their level**. Perhaps your hands-on experience will equip you with the ability to talk details with designers or developers, but you need to be able to speak a different language when taking the same conversation to someone else, like a client for instance. Not just your use of jargon, you'll also need to carefully consider your overall approach, your language, your tone.

Designers and developers especially might be quite territorial and defensive of their work and so any comments, feedback, or requests must be framed delicately so that you convey trust in their skills and abilities. If you say anything, even accidentally, that makes them feel belittled or reduced to the status of pixel pusher or code monkey then motivation is instantly crushed and the project will suffer. This takes practice and it pays off to be open about your approach to conversation, especially with people you haven't worked with much before, by asking directly if what you're saying seems totally reasonable and always asking if they have their own comments or suggestions.

While with designers you might want to use inspecific language, allowing their creativity to flourish, developers will want logical and straightforward speak. Similarly, while you can jest with the designers about certain “comic” typefaces, or with developers about the web browser that always gives them problems (you know the one I'm talking about!), your clients, client managers, and bosses on the other hand are no interested in the implementation details, no matter how proud you are of them, and just want to hear about decisions, progress, results, and impact. Remember that no personality trait is negative in all circumstances, save say predilection to constant outrage, and as part of your role as the linchpin holding the team together you must be able to adapt to and bring together each individual.

### Resolving Conflicts

You are inevitably going to annoy people as a project manager. You have to balance budgets, timelines, and constantly make decisions that will always leave some people less than satisfied. You can't please everyone all the time. For example, in such a fast-paced industry new tools, technologies, and techniques are emerging every day and designers or developers probably often suggest jumping on one bandwagon or another. If you disagree with them then they're going to get annoyed (in this situation you might want to suggest a suitable side-project?). Just as inevitably, others are going to annoy you, and each other. It's simply the nature of working in a busy team. The best you can expect as a project manager is to earn reputation points and respect for getting the job done well. Reputation, however, is a fragile thing.

We've already covered the importance of empathy and honesty, the understanding of people's motives and perspectives when making decisions. The best way to pre-emptively avoid conflicts in a team is to prepare in advance and consider what would make each team member happy and what would annoy them; how can you make them happy and what can you do when they're likely to be annoyed?

Your boss or agency director wants revenue, a well-managed cash-flow, and happy clients that will refer more business. For this they need the project completed on time, on budget, and to a level of quality they personally deem satisfactory. You need to make a solid plan, stay on top of things, and identify and work towards meeting or exceeding that particular level of quality. Clients want a project that's future proof, easy enough to maintain, and facilitates their organisation's goals. It just has to look great and work perfectly. Designers want to push the boundaries, make something that stands out, something that they can be proud to show off. Developers want to play with the latest technologies and implement efficient, cutting edge solutions. You hopefully want all of the above and other project managers that you may work with just want your projects to be on schedule so as not to impact theirs. Keep in mind that you're very unlikely to be able to keep everyone happy all the time but that ultimately everyone wants want they think is best for the project so you can focus on that shared goal.

Let's take a common example of a difficult decision you might face that has the potential for causing conflict: the developer suggesting a new technology. First consider why they are suggesting it. Does it bring potential performance benefits? Will it improve efficiency, allowing for less repetition in future projects? Or maybe they just want to play around with it and learn about it on the company's dime. You need to have the aptitude and willingness to research that technology quickly and assess its potential risks and benefits in the context of the project, the client's aims, and your organisational workflow. Being ultimately responsible for the project, you'll need a full understanding before you can make a decision, and you'll need to have absolute trust in the developers' ability to make good use of the technology. Whatever you decide, you'll need to communicate clearly and justify your decision to everyone.

If you choose to go with it, you should highlight the potential benefits to your boss and the project owner, with the caveat of the added risk to project timelines. They may try to overrule your decision, in which case you'll have to convince them. If you reject the developer's suggestion then you'll need to give them more than just a “no”. Perhaps you've determined that the new technology risks and already fragile client relationship, or that the risks outweigh the benefits compared to your current stable solutions. Maybe the new technology is not mature or battle-tested enough. Perhaps there are browser or platform considerations or not enough budget to risk overruns. There are plenty of reasons, and after explaining them the chances are your developers are still going to be unhappy. You might be labelled as the PM with your head stuck in the sand, holding the company back. But have conviction in your decisions. While the developer is wholly focused on the technical solutions, you're the only one with a complete overview of the project and it's you who are ultimately responsible for it. Hopefully regularly communicating this to the team will raise their awareness and make them more considerate of the business, not just technical, decisions.

What about your boss when you go over budget? You will be burdened with the assumption that the project has been badly managed. When this is the case, and you know it's the case, simply admit it, learn from it, and take those learnings to the next project. We can but learn from our mistakes. On occasion though you might want to deliberately make decisions that will cause the project to go overbudget or some other such dicision that will displease your boss. For example you might have a team member focused on training, you might be experimenting with new project management processes, you might be supporting a side a project that benefits the agency, or you might be doing extra work to please an important client. If you've analysed the situation and you are in the position of making such a decision then you should communicate it to your boss before announcing it to the team. If you can mitigate upsetting news with something that adds value or provides return on investment then you should get approval and respect for your decision.

Say a client wants to add a new feature that's out of scope. I know, this **never** happens, right? You can't just say “no” and damage the client relationship, but then you can't screw up all your budgets and timelines and resource allocations by outright agreeing to it. Consider for a moment that perhaps the client has additional budget available or may be willing to extend the project's timeline? Are any parts of the project running ahead of schedule or under budget? Maybe you might be able to accommodate the new request? The client may be willing to sacrifice another feature for this one one, or maybe there's a quick and easy way to implement a similar feature that could be upgraded later. There's also a chance that building this feature might benefit your team or agency, giving them new skills or a new offering to sell to other clients. Only ever say “no” to a client when there's absolutely nothing in the universe that can be done. The client probably isn't just being cheeky, trying to squeeze as much out of your agency as possible, nor frivolously expecting your team's work on new features to be easy. The request probably comes from a reaction to something in their industry that they understand better than you. There is probably a good reason why they're asking for it so even if you have to reject the request, understanding the reasoning behind it and offering a good alternative will reduce the chance of conflict. As at the start of the project, talk the client through this new feature, the business reason, and the expected KPI. As always, assess the situation thoroughly and then make your decision. If you agree, you'll have a happy client. If you reject, then, as with the developer, as with your boss, take them through the decision process step by step; explain the risks, explain the situation, and discuss the alternatives. The more transparent you are, the more understanding the client will be.

There are of course many other situations where you will face being the cause of conflict but these three examples demonstrate a common theme. Analyse the situation, make a decision, communicate the decision, and find a solution. Easy right? 

What about situations when you're not the cause of the conflict, such as conflicts within the team or between teams? Digital families can be fairly disfunctional. You're no doubt aware of the age-old (well, say 20 year old) conflict between web designers and developers, like squabbling children. And you're surely all too aware that the children complain about their parents - the project managers...

The underlying cause of these conflicts is clashing priorities, arrogance, incompetence, and lack of awareness. Unfortunately, you're always going to have to deal with these in your role as a web project manager.

Dealing with each team member and having an overall view of the project, you're in the best position to deal with these problems. We've already talked briefly about the different priorities of each role. By having an understanding of these priorities and being able to empathise, you have to find a way to champion the notion that everyone is working toward the same goal - project success - and that nobody is deliberately trying to screw anyone else over so that all team members are more willing to compromise.

Arrogance is something we've all encountered in this industry, and probably something we've all been guilty of once or twice. It's natural for highly skilled experts to have confidence in their skills and knowledge and react defensively when challenged. They dig their heels and seem to want to deliberately obstruct the progress of a web project until they get their way. All you can do here is try to remove barriers. If someone is seemingly being difficult, recognise that it's probably just pride in the work and find a way to turn that to something positive. Take them aside for a private conversation and listen to their concerns, make them realise that their concerns are at least being acknowledged. Make sure you understand their reasoning and then respectfully explain how you need to move things forward. Perhaps explain with a personal annecdote or offer an example of similar issues another person or team is facing. Help them to appreciate that it's not just them facing this situation, give them an overall picture of the project and how this issue is impacting it, then end the conversation with a deal aimed at removing the barrier.

Incompetence is an easily thrown accusation, particularly between designers and developers. A designer might blame a developer for not fully implementing their original vision, or a developer might get irritated with a designer for handing off disorganised and unrealistic mockups with overly complicated layouts. These situations arise, of course, due to lack of communication and short timelines, but also sometimes it's due to genuine incompetence and that's where you have to step in to address it. Sometimes, for whatever reason, people just don't do their work properly. You could allow the slagging match to continue, you might even be tempted to take sides, but that's obviously only going to exacerbate the situation. Instead we need to find a positive way to solve the problem. You'll be the mediator, resetting the tone of the conversation and having all parties involved in a clear, informal, and open discussion about how to resolve the problem. Can we simplify the layout? Can we allow more time for development and testing? How do we avoid this problem in the future? You'll hopefully notice how surprisingly easy it is to turn the tone from a spiteful one to a positive and constructive one, allowing for mutual empathy.

Another common cause for internal squabbling is when the team members aren't given a clear overall picture of the project, along with its business goals and limitations. A good developer will want full feature testing, accessibility testing, security testing, user testing, the works. But in many cases there just may not be the time or the budget. Skipping such steps, that they deem important, without explaining to them the reasons conveys the message that you don't care about quality or standards, and they will find your decisions loathesome. It's simply not the case that your team can't understand or isn't interested in the business decisions. They too may be on career paths that will someday put them in the position of making the difficult decisions that now burden you. If you can find a way to communicate the business decisions to them then you'll make them care about the business decisions as much as you do and will appreciate that sometimes they will have to put together dirty hacks. Hopefully you'll be able to learn from those times and allow more time and budget for standards compliance in future projects.

Finally, no matter what the cause of the conflict is, try and resolve it yourself first. You should never feel the need to escalate the issue to your boss or manager. This will only add to their stress and decrease your value to them, as well as setting a poor example to your production team, whom you should keep leading and motivating. Education in skills, business, increased knowledge, and heightened awareness are your tools here. As we've talked about many in times in this chapter already, it begins with empathy - understanding the problem from all sides, listening to any and all grievances, and then finding common ground to keep the project moving forward before conflicts turn nasty and become irreprably damaging to the current project and to to future ones.

## Make a Plan

So far in this chapter we've mostly covered what it takes to be a successful web project manager, or indeed any manager, the personality traits and the social challenges. This is all arguably the most important aspect of a successful project - you don't need to have the best team with the best skills but if you have a great team that work really well together then you're sure to produce successful work.

Now though let's get into the fun stuff - the actual tasks your individual role covers and how to best perform them. Here is where it starts - planning. Meticulous, hair-raising, sweat-inducing planning.

The web is as littered with articles about project management planning as library shelves are stuffed with books on the topic. Each one stuffed with corporate jargon and calling for specific methodologies that must be strictly followed lest the world cave in on you. They make different assumptions about how much time you have or what sort of team you're working with. The realty is that every project and every team is different. A PMP qualification isn't necessarily going to get you anywhere. There are no hard and fast rules and so we shalln't be covering such rules here. Instead we'll try to be more general, talking about things you need to think about when devising your own system.

Web project managers should get into the habit of thorough and consistent planning so as to make it a repeatable and reliable process for every project. Skills learned in doing so are entirely transferrable to other roles too. Thorough planning is especially important for freelancers and smaller agencies, where there is less room for error as mistakes could have a bigger impact on the overall business. The industry is moving quickly and is reaching a level of maturity that necessitates professional management processes to ensure quality that stands-out among ever-increasing competition. Clients are becoming more web savvy and capable of judging the professionalism, competence, and consistency of a production team.

Why do we even bother planning? We have a team of experts to hand. Sit a designer down in front of a blank canvas with some content, and a developer with a code editor, a functional spec. and a styleguide, give them a few weeks and all we be good right? Project planning, or the lack of it, can lead to extremely different results. By planning well we're able to clearly define and manage the project scope, identify and minise risks, and break the allocated time into manageable chunks and tasks. We can determine reaslistic milestones, track progress, maintain control, and secure resources.

This all sounds totally obvious to you now, right? But as you're surely aware, detailed and effective planning that covers all of these bases is not always done, for varying reasons.

As much as you want to create and maintain a great plan, you may simply not have time. A good plan may take more than a day. It may take a week, or more. Massive projects demand massive planning. Perhaps you're juggling multiple projects at the same time and you can't devote all your time every day to this master plan. It will seem like your planning time is stalling everything else; your content person or designer might be idly waiting. More time = more cost. Ideally, you might argue that a good plan always saves time and money in the long run, but depending on the project this might not always be the case. You may need to break down the planning itself into smaller, more manageable chunks, just enough to give you a detailed and immediate overview of the tasks at hand. Unfortunately, effective planning does demand your full attention. If you're going to be handling other projects then you'll need to allocate time in the plans for those projects so that you have time to plan this one. Try and isolate yourself from meetings and emails and phone calls, for at least a day, so that you can sit down and deep dive into this particular project. Consider it the same as taking a sick day, which is beyond your control, and may also impact other projects. You always manage to catch up afterwards and the situation you'll be in afterwards, equipped with a good plan, is akin to being well-rested and raring to go.

As the old saying goes, time is money. When quoting the cost for a new project you may have to put in more effort justifying the time needed for planning because it doesn't directly produce deliverables that the client or projects owner values. They want a website or app, not a 50 page PDF document; the plan is for your team's internal use, so why should they be paying for it? Project management likely takes between 10-20% of the total time that it takes to put the project together, much of it planning. You'll need to ensure that budget is available for this before starting. Lack of budget is no excuse for lack of planning. If no budget is available for planning, then you'll probably have to recouperate it from design or development time.

Maybe you're a small agency or solitary freelancer and your project scopes and budgets are so small and simple that you don't deem planning necessary. But the more you do it the quicker and easier it will become. For smaller projects it's even easier because you have less to focus on. And focus is the key - a good plan that you can share with all stakeholders not only looks professional but keeps everyone focused on the goals and what they need to do to achieve them.

Not everyone can put together good plans. Effective planning is an acquired skill. Being at the point of starting any plan is a daunting feeling no matter how experienced you are or how many books and articles you've read. Experience is always the most valuable commodity when refining any skill. Lack of it, however, is never an excuse to dismiss planning as a waste of time or not worth the effort. You may still manage to keep your boss and your clients happy with the work you deliver despite not putting together detailed plans; you'll still get paid. It's like cooking. You could buy a packet that you just add to the pan and heat up or you could buy all the ingredients and make the dish from scratch. You've been told making it from scratch will yield much better results. You may even believe this. But it's a lot of extra effort, probably costs more, and will only yield better results than the convenient packet if you know what you're doing and have cooking experience. Eventually though, after you've cooked the dish many times, you will be able to put it together quickly, easily, and will enjoy it much more. If you invite people to try it, they will notice the difference between the packet and the home-cooked version, and they will be impressed with your efforts.

Sometimes, a plan just fails entirely. Nothing goes as planned and you end up pulling your hair out. This can only put down to bad planning so you'll have to adjust your planning techniques. Other times planning might actually just over-complicate things. Plans that are long, boring, filled with waffle or unnecessary detail may be ignored or not fully absorbed. Overly detailed plans that demand updating GANTT charts every few hours or wireframing nearly empty pages may be unrealstic to stick to at best, or at worst just a waste of time. Sometimes you just need to get stuck in and start doing rather than just planning. You have to assess for each project the level of detail required and the when you should update the schedule to perform crucial tasks. Remember that the goal is to maintain control over the project, so you'll need to be flexible enough to know when to plan and when to do.

Another reason why planning is often lacklustre or skipped entirely is the sad fact that planning isn't always fun. Some people like it, while others hate it. Sometimes you might just not be in the mood. If you really don't feel like it then there's no really good advice other than to try and change the way you plan to make it more enjoyable and rewarding. If you come out on the other side of a project knowing that your plan helped and made your life easier, if everything “went to plan”, then you'll surely be rewarded with the smug feeling of success. If you really can't find a way to make planning enjoyable, even tolerable, then sorry... it's just something you're going to have to do. You might want to try hacking your brain to associate it with something positive, some other reward? On days you allocate to planning, ignore all your emails, cancel your meetings, setup an isolated room, make it comfy, and play your favourite music, and get your favourite snacks. Soon you'll start looking forward to planning days.

If you've worked with other managers before, you'll be aware that there are different kinds of planning personalities. There are those who don't enjoy detailed planning and dive straight into production. They are up and running quickly and solve problems in an ad-hoc fashion, as and when they arise. On the other hand there are those who start slowly, meticulously planning every step along the way, slowly gaining momentum, ensuring every task is completed successfully before moving on. The hare and the tortoise, so to speak.

To a large degree, your success with either approach will depend on your personality and on your team. The hard, fast, slap-dash approach may seem crazy but people do manage to pull it off, producing a successful project on time, on budget, and to a high standard of quality. If you can motivate a higlight skilled team and confidently make snap decisions then why not? Maybe someone who spends all their time putting out fires inherently has a greater sense of purpose? Maybe being so obviously busy acts to motivate the team? Maybe they just feed on the adrenaline? More likely they're just extremely busy people facing the weighty pressures of cash flow, unrealistic and inflexible deadlines, project overload, lack of project management skills and experience, or all of the above.

A safer approach may be to try and prevent fires _before_ they start. It may be less glamourous but also less damaging. Someone who takes this more measured approach is probably has more time and fewer projects on thier hands, is more experienced, has a fear of emergencies and unnecessary risk. Maybe they even enjoy meticulous planning and have had success with it before.

Which approach is better is largely irrelevant as it's beyond your control. You can't change your personality. Likewise, especially in smaller teams or agencies, you are just going to have to skip all or most of the all-important planning phase due to time constraints and suchlike. You know it's bad but you don't have an option. You can only take comfort in knowing that the more blazes you have to battle, the better you will be come at reducing them to smouldering embers. You may be able to rely on having a placid client or a stellar team and that will go a long way towards helping you produce a great end result. But the minute something goes wrong and you lose control, you're going to struggle reigning the project in when you have poor documentation, ambiguous or non-existent scope definition, and unclear sign-offs. The more organised, detailed planning approach at least offers you more consistency. You'll become accustomed to what kind of problems occur at what stages and you'll be better prepared to comprehensively deal with them. Without a detailed plan you also have no recourse when facing angry clients. Armed with a plan, you can clearly point out the how, when, who, what, and why when things inevitably go wrong, allowing the client to understand and accept the situation. Essentially, there's no guaranteed way to project success. There will always be unforseen problems which you may be able to pre-empt or prepare for, or may not. What you can guarantee is that the probability of success is much higher, and the risk much lower, when you have a plan and you stick to it. That ought to keep everyone focused.

### Key Performance Indicators

Earlier we talked about the KPIs for your role and the benefit being that you remain focused on what's important to be successful and your decisions can be guided by clear objectives. Similarly when it comes to planning project you need to determine what are its measures of success. What should your production team stay focused on at all times throughout the project lifecycle. These project-specific KPIs should be documented at the top of your plan before project kickoff and shared among all project stakeholders, which of course includes your team. 

In fact, these KPIs should be listed on all project documentation, including not just your plan but also on specifications, creative briefs, sitemaps, even somewhere in the source code comments. They should be verbally reiterated in meetings at the start of each project phase, and also when dicussing any new feature or change requests. All assigned tasks should be framed in the context of KPIs. Why are we bulding this feature? To achieve target X. Why do we have to remove that section? Because it doesn't meet condition X.

The client manager's original proposal, or sometimes even documentation from the client, should detail the business goals and/or KPIs. In your role you have to analyse and challenge these where necessary to ensure they are realistic, measurable, and provide sufficient context. For the most part, the KPIs listed in your plan will be the same. Where they explicitly impact production, for instance when making demands on performance, technologies, platforms and so on, those KPIs should be expanded and explained in more detail where possible to provide clarity for your team.

KPIs have to be carefully considered. As an example, imagine you're asked to increase website traffic by 10%. You record the average traffic on the current website over a fixed length period. Post-launch, you monitor the traffic for the same length of time. Compare the two and you should know what percentage improvement you've achieved, right? But what if the client had run a marketing campaign while you were gathering pre-launch metrics and it had skewed the data? Or if a new competitor launches around the same time, impacting a fair comparison of post-launch metrics? There are many business factors that should be taken into consideration when formulating KPIs. With a little research you should increase the chance of being able to produce equally rated comparative metrics.

KPIs are surprisingly easy to forumulate for the enormous potential benefits they offer. Furthermore they cover not just the tools and technologies but also the business goals. That means that achieving business goals brings business value. Finally they also provide a boundary for client requests. When the client requests something that's out of scope, you or your client manager can go back and ask which KPI the request serves. If not related to any of the established and agreed KPIs, the client will hopefully withdraw the request, meaning you've kept **them** focused on **their** business goals, saved them money, and preserved the project's scope and timeline.

One important set of KPIs for all web projects is the **performance budget**. Performance is crucial for the success of every modern web project and dependent on so many factors that it needs to be at the forefront of everyone's minds throughout production. Performance isn't just about code either - it starts with content and information architectire and design. Not only are increasing numbers of users on low-bandwidth devices or in areas with slower connections, but they are increasingly accustomed to using blazingly fast sites and apps like Google which, whether strictly fair or not, set their expectations. Things that affect performance might be:

* Total initial download for new users
* Total initial download for return users
* Total number of HTTP requests (if using HTTP1.*)
* Initial load time on X bandwidth
* Return load time on X bandwidth
* A minimum score of X on Google Pagespeed Insights
* Wcag 2.0 compliance
* Memory usage

These performance KPIs highlight the benefits of KPIs being useful for decision making. During production if you test against your KPI metric while adding a new feature and fail, you have 3 easy options:

* Optimise an existing feature or asset
* Remove an existing feature or asset
* Don’t add the new feature or asset

They will ultimately depend on implementation details - what technology you're using to produce the website or app - and also target audience - what technology the users are using to access the website or app - but you should determine early what goals you should estabish for which of these (or other?) variables. Whatever goals you decide on, you need to be able to gather accurate before and after metrics. You also need to be confident that you stick to your targets. For instance, you might find out later that restricting yourself to your 150KB total payload goal turns out to be a real struggle. Rather than letting yourself off or adjusting the KPI, effectively moving the goal posts, you'll have to perhaps forgo certain features that might require 3rd-party libraries. In this case you should revisit this particular KPI and ask yourself why the goal was set at 150KB in the first place.

### Setting Scope, Identifying Risks, and Assigning Tasks

To establish scope, you need to speak at length with the client or client manager, break the project down into specific feature requirements, going into as much detail as possible. Set some time aside and talk for as long as it takes, documenting everything. If the conversation leaves any gaps in the required information, then document the assumptions you need to make; these could be placeholders that you could ellaborate on later.

Your objective here is to get a list of specific feature requirements (i.e. functionality), along with any other general requirements (e.g. design theme). From there you can break those down into individual tasks. You should try to be as granular as is reasonable - the smaller the task the more manageable it is. You can then assess what resources will be required for each task and for how long, being sure to be generous with your estimates. By summing up the total time and resources required you can compare with the available time and budget. If you go over the limit on one or both of these, then another meeting is required in which you need to agree to either extend the budget or deadline, or somehow reduce or simplify the feature set. This is why planning takes time - several rounds of requirements gathering, analysis, and revisions.

And the end of this process you should have a detailed albeit high-level plan which you can input into your task tracking system that outlines all of the required features, who will be working on them, and how long they should take. You are now in a position to guard against scope screep because you can check any feature requests against the list you have. You have identified potential risks and bottlenecks by determining which tasks will take longest and which depend on others. You have an agreed deadline before which you are confident all tasks can be completed. You're ready to plan the project schedule. You are in control.

### Timing

Now that you have a clear list of resource-allocated feature-based tasks you can start to plan who should do what when. Aside from those tasks, you'll also need to plan for client tasks, changes and revisions, depdencies, lag times, resource availability, and milestones. This may just sound like jargon, but they are things that inevitably act as hurdles in every single project.

#### Client Tasks

Outlining the client's responsibilities explicitly here in the project schedule highlights to them what they need to do and when they need to do it by. They are probably busy people too, or might be working on a different schedule or in a timezone to you and your team. You need to make them aware in advance when they will be needed to provide content or media or feedback and how they might impact deadlines if they are late.

#### Changes & Revisions

For each milestone (more on milestones later), you'll want to plan for some time for reflection where both the client's team and yours can go through the features delivered so far and assess whether anything might need to be changed. Like you did with the initial feature requests for the project, these change requests will be broken down into specific tasks. If you have enough time to complete these tasks now, great, but if not you'll need to establish their urgency and maybe move things around in the schedule before pushing the project forward.

#### Dependencies

These are generally fairly easy to spot. Task B cannot be started until Task A is complete. For example, a design style guide for form input elements must be completed and signed off before part of a page with a form can be designed. Design for a hero section on the homepage cannot begin until content has been prepared for that section. CMS integration cannot be completed until the front-end templates are complete (and fully tested!). And so on. Marking dependencies clearly in the schedule higlights to everybody how their work impacts that of others. Everyone's tasks are clearly illustrated on the timeline; this is particularly useful to clients and project owners who may otherwise be under the assumption that they can sit back and let your team get on with it. This way they can quickly understand what is required of them as well. Another handy feature of maintaining timeline dependencies is that you can immediately see how far back milestones and deadlines will be shifted when there are unexpected delays. When deadlines do need to be shifted, you're going to have an angry client unless you can clearly communicate the reasons. The dependency timeline will make communicating them much easier, and the new deadlines more acceptable (especially if the client can see that it was their missed delivery that caused the delay!).

Dependency timelines naturally start to look like a waterfall, with tasks flowing from the top left - the initial tasks - to the bottom right - those at the end of the project. That is not to say however that this is a project management methodology or that everyone's work should be carried out in sequential phases, but we'll cover more on this later.

#### Lag

Lag is all the extra time it takes to complete a task or feature that you should account for in your timeline. For example, you ask a developer how long it will take to complete feature X. They tell you 4 hours and for good measure you might put down 8 hours, or 1 day, in case it actually takes them longer (such things are notoriously difficult to predict). In fact, you need to also account for a few hours of testing, maybe a day for client review and feedback, then yet more time for changes and revisions, and another feedback loop. It now seems more sensible to allocate 3 or 4 days for this task, despite the initial assumption that it could be complete in 4 hours. At first this may sound like all of your projects are going to go on forever. A great plan though will account for overlapping tasks, even if they have some level of dependency. Going back to our example, a developer could complete their task and then move onto the next one while the tester is testing or the client is reviewing. By the time the tester or client's feedback has arrived they may have completed their next task, allowing the tester or client to go on and review that while the developer makes the required changes to the original task. Smooth workflow demands that you try to consider all the variables and also the available resources, then add a big of contingency lag time.

#### Resource Planning

This is pure project management jargon - when we say resources, we mean people. You hopefully have a varied team of people that bring a different mix of skills and skill levels. Planning your project efficiently involves sharing the workload among them, ensuring that their time is optimised and that nobody is sitting around waiting for others to complete their tasks on which their own work depends. Most timeline tools will allow you to assign tasks to specific team members. This will give you an overview of who you need to work on what and when, which is very useful in teams that handle multiple project simultaneously. Maybe some team members will be unavailable or committed to other projects during certain periods so you will need to adjust your timeline to accommodate or re-assign the tasks to someone else. 

Resource planning is important not just for your projects but for your team as a whole. Ongoing problems with resource planning may indicate that your team is under or over-staffed. If you find yourself assigning more tasks to one team member than you are to others, or that one person is suffering under a larger workload, then you may be able to identify skillsets that your team may be lacking, causing certain team members to be spread too thinly. Conversely if you have a team member who is rarely assigned tasks, maybe they could be reassigned to another role or trained in some new, more useful skills?

Resource planning a huge topic in itself and there is not really any solid advice anyone can give you. The major difficulty is in guessing, for it is guesswork, how long it will take someone to complete a particular task. The reason nobody can give you any bulletproof advice is because it depends entirely on the people you're working with - everyone works at different speeds - so it's just something you'll have to learn to improve as you go along. The best advice is to always try and break each task down into the smallest possible chunks that can should be completable in the shortest possible time. Short, quick task assignments are easier to manage and monitor. If there is an overrun, say if someone is struggling, then you can react quickly by assinging some help, even stepping in to help yourself, or by re-arranging your timeline to mitigate the impact on project milestones.

#### Setting Milestones

Milestones differ from deadlines in that they are internal goals, points at which your team can stop, having completed a pre-determined set of tasks or features, regroup, collect your thoughts, and review the work completed so far. Milestones are how you gauge the project progress. You might find that you need to reorganise your plan, redo some tasks, or plan for some unforseen work. Deadlines on the other hand are final cut-off dates, points at which nothing more can or should be done. Missing a deadline means that something went wrong, whereas missing a milestone just means that things aren't going quite to plan and a change needs to be made. Maybe you just didn't include enough lag time? Maybe it was beyond your control as someone fell ill? The clue is in the name - stones marking each mile of a long journey versus death - the end of everything. Milestones certainly sound a lot friendlier.

If you can complete each project phase before reaching each milestone date, then you can be sure the project is on track to be completed on top. It's up to you how often you set milestones. The project tasks may lend themselves to obvious phases, or otherwise you may just wish to set arbitrary or regular milestones just to keep everyone motivated and to maintain closer control over project progress. Alternatively, if you're confident that you can stay on top of things then you may not need to set milestones at all.

#### Accuracy vs. Guesswork

If the first part of this chapter sounded challenging, suggesting you need to be some kind of psychologist to resolve all your team members' personal issues, then you might think sitting down and drawing up a timeline will be easy. In fact, it's the hardest part of a web project manager's job. The sheer complexities of estimating and quoting timelines for web projects means you're going to do it wrong... ***a lot***. Just try a Google search for the phrase "how can I stop completing web projects on time?".

There are aspects of this role that you will enjoy, while others you don't. Few people enjoy estimating timings purely because it's such hard work and rarely proves to be entirely successful. It takes a lot of time and concentration, both of which you may not be able to spare under the weight of your existing workload. You have to predict the future. Especially if the cost for the project is based on the estimated time, then it makes you ultimately responsible for the sales success as well as the quality of the implementation, maybe even the profitability of your team or agency! If you are someone from a technical or creative background, passionate about creating and building stuff, then this is understandably going to be a joyless part of your job. Nevertheless it has to be done and you should take comfort in knowing that if you get it right, then you'll be rewarded with a warm fuzzy feeling that more than compensates.

There are so many reasons for it being difficult to plan web project timings accurately, for example:

* new untested technologies, tools, and techniques
* loosely defined scope
* imprecise specifications
* bespoke or industry-specific features
* no analysis having been done of estimated vs. actual delivery times for past projects
* client pressure to provide estimates quickly
* financial pressure to get to work and deliver quickly

And there are many other potential reasons. It's a miserable feeling indeed knowing that you've underestimated and thus committed you and your team to overtime and rushed work. And yet it's a feeling that you may get time and time again as you try and fail to formulate rhobust plans. Unfortunately, it all comes down to guesswork. The best you can do is sit down in advance and think about the potential risks to your timeline and try and find ways to reduce them.

Taking one of the examples from the list above, if you want to try a new technology that your team might be unfamiliar with, then you should probably spend some time researching or practicing with it first. Obviously you don't want to be doing this for free, nor does the project owner really want to be paying for it unless they get a clear cost benefit. In this case you could perhaps compromise by charging a reduced fee for a research phase that includes work on the simpler tasks. You could create a more high-level project plan based on this, to which you can add more detail once your team have had chance to use the new technology in this experimental phase and can therefore more accurately assess timings. In the best case scenario you've learned a new technology and kept the client happy with a low cost while still being productive. At worst you've still learned a new technology and made some revenue.

I may not believe in the Devil, but I do believe this statement to be as true as it gets when it comes to estimating time for web projects.

Some would say this is an oxymoron, and to some extent I would agree, but I do believe by applying a few techniques it’s possible to drastically increase the accuracy of most web project estimates and avoid the feeling of wanting to curl up in the foetal position and whimper helplessly under your duvet.

Before you embark on any detailed estimate exercise it’s crucial to immediately confirm with the client a rough budget, or budget range, they feel would be acceptable for an estimate. After all, if you get a new business lead, spend three days estimating and deliver a proposal worth £30,000 only to hear that the client ‘appreciates your response’ but only has £3000 to spend, you probably deserve to be struck with reasonable force in the baby-making department.

When you receive a project brief, throw some figures out there for the client to comment on, only one of a possible few things will happen:

They will laugh and hang up when they hear your daily rate
You will laugh and hang up when you hear they want Facebook for £4000
They will say you’re in the right area but probably need to come down or go up a little bit
They will refuse to feedback and say “We are open to suggestions”
For these possibilities what the next steps are need little explanation, but the “we are open to suggestions” answer is always the trickiest. In these cases it really is down to you to make a decision if the project is worth the risk of spending time writing a proposal and estimating for. It could be that the potential for new work is huge, or the client is extremely high profile and thus often it’s worth it, however, if you feel none of these are true, you should probably ask yourself what this statement says about the client and if you want to work with them.

It’s understandable a client wants to get their website or web application at the lowest cost, but the best clients are the most professional, experienced and ethical ones and simply know that not providing a rough budget range could waste theirs and your time.

Assuming you have made the decision to pursue the lead, you can now begin the detailed estimating exercise.

Most web projects can be broken down into the following high-level categories:

Research and planning
Solution design
Functional specification
Web design
Front-end development
Back-end development
Content entry
Each individual project will contain unique tasks, but most can be encapsulated in the above phases.

The first step to increasing accuracy of web project estimates is to make sure you always begin with a consistent set of categories and then add as many sub-categories and tasks as you like.

Now your consistent high-level project phases are defined, it’s time to get granular and add sub-phases and tasks e.g.:

Research and planning
Requirements gathering
Project planning
Solution design
Sitemap
Wireframes
User workflows
Functional specification
Design
Initial homepage look and feel
Content page
Master content page template
News main page
News item
Front-end development
Template x5 XHTML/CSS
Cross-browser fixes
Back-end development
CMS Setup and configuration
News feature
Contact us form
Content entry
This full list of required project tasks can be created based on the pre-sales research you have conducted with the client. It is imperative to nail down, in as much detail as possible, what exactly the client wants before you submit an estimate or begin work.

The more granular you can get, the more you are forced at this early stage to think through each part of the project, literally designing and building the website or application from beginning to end in your head.

By going through the project step-by-step, putting yourself in the shoes of the information architect, the designer and all developers, will often immediately result in many issues rearing their head that you need to clarify before putting in an estimate, take the News feature for example. Ideally you could break each feature down as much as you can, so the News feature may actually end up looking like the following:

News feature
Add/edit/delete new item
Upload image
Attach PDF
Auto-archiving
RSS
By resisting the temptation to just think “News… ummm… 5 hours” and breaking it down to this level means you’re mentally building the feature step-by-step and raising questions as you go.

So the client needs to be able to upload images to their news items, ok, but do they need:

Auto-resize capability?
Auto-thumbnail generation?
Full-screen viewing?
Caption addition facility?
I’m sure you can think of many more questions that could be associated with a simple upload image for a news item requirement. This demonstrates the possible scope variations that are contained within even the smallest of features and that could impact your estimates / risk of underestimating.

By getting granular and mentally trying to build the solution you are able to identify and address these issues early on, making sure to cater for them in your final estimate.

A Web Project Manager knows how to design and develop most of the project on his own, even if with poorer results compared to his team. This allows him to estimate projects with good approximation and to understand his team’s problems and difficulties
Introduction to Web Project Management: Fucina Web

Don’t forget, by getting this granular not only increases your estimations accuracy, but it also gives you the instant ability to remove proposed features quickly if your estimate exceeds the client’s maximum budget! Need to shave 10 hours off the budget? Well, rather than removing the News feature entirely, how about remove the thumbnail and caption adding functionality from News, and a few other small niceties from other features and still allow the client to have the basic versions of all the features they need? Simply remove the lines and hey presto, a new estimate at warp speed and with full visibility to the client of what functionality they’re sacrificing for budget.

Roughly guessing the News feature will take 5 hours is one thing, but what about when the client comes to you after seeing the initial functional specification and asks where the archive section is or how they attach PDFs simply because they assumed the News section they would be getting is like the News section on another website they’d seen?

Getting granular will not always allow you to breakout a required feature in full because it is client industry specific. If you are ever in any doubts about what the client needs, ASK THEM! Take the time to understand their business so that you can fully understand why they want the feature and how it needs to work.

Few clients mind you asking questions, if anything it tends to give them more confidence that you will continue to be as diligent and thorough if they hire you.

Best of all, if you win the work, by getting granular you have:

An instant statement of work
A defined project scope
The timings you need to put together an accurate project schedule with milestones
Set your client’s expectations very early
Demonstrated your thoroughness and understanding of their business to the client
By being methodical, transparent and getting granular from the very start means your client is well informed and you’re seriously reducing the chances of friction later down the line.

YOU WON THE WORK W00T! TIME TO START TRACKING TIME
The more projects you complete that are categorised with a consistent set of phases and tasks, the more useful data you can collect on how long you estimated versus how long each phase or task actually took.

Consistency here is the key again. By this stage you should have the final project estimate that was approved by the client, and this estimate should be broken down first into the same high-level phases as your previous projects, and then at a granular level by task and sub-task.

Simply replicate this structure and the time estimates for each in your time tracking tool of choice so that you can:

See how long you have to complete each phase
View how long you have for each task and sub-task
At the end, report on how long everything took
Not only is this a perfect way to track the progress of the project you are working on, but the data you collect over multiple projects, using a consistent pattern, will become more and more valuable when it comes to estimating future projects and also allow you to identify bottlenecks in your project processes.

ANALYSE PROJECT ESTIMATES VS. ACTUAL TIME SPENT
Once you have defined a consistent set of high-level project phases to use when estimating all web projects, and committed to setting up your time tracking tool each time to match, you are ready to reap the rewards.

By tracking all the estimated and actual times of all past projects, using a consistent framework, will give you an average percentage that each phase and task took, and you can use these averages as a good guide for starting a new estimate.

For example, by collecting data for your past five projects you are able to identify trends like:

Solution design took around 10% of the total project time to complete and get approved
Web design 30%
Front-end development 15%
Back-end development 30%
And so on…

Using these averages, and with a client’s preferred budget, you can begin to immediately allocate a rough amount of time to each phase and then break out each in more detail, but with the roughly allowed hours available known beforehand.

With this initial capped time limit in place, you can estimate not only your times but also the most cost-efficient solution you can deliver based on the budget rather than going in with a blind quote that may be way to small or too high.

Of course, this is dependent on knowing the client’s budget beforehand, not always possible, but more possible than most seem to think if you just explain you want to deliver the best solution for the budget given that you could potentially offer a News feature that costs £750 or £7,500.

GET GRANULAR WITH FEATURES, AGAIN!
Aside from being able to determine the average percentage of time each high-level phase usually takes of each project, you can take this tracking and analysis one step further.

How many websites or web applications tend to need a feature you’ve implemented before? Small to medium business websites invariably demand the following functionalities:

News
Press Releases
Case Studies
Events

At the estimating stage you will have identified these requirements and broken them down as much as you can. Not only can you re-use these common breakdowns in multiple quotes, if you track the time for each one over multiple projects you will also begin to have average times it takes to implement or migrate each feature – now that’s useful.

IN SUMMARY
The approach for estimating time for web projects I have described to you in this article works for me. It’s something I’ve developed over several years through trial and error by having to estimate web projects of all shapes and sizes in a small web agency environment, combined with a lot of good old fashioned hours of research.

Its methodical, it’s laborious, isn’t a guarantee that a project will not go over budget and I’ve no doubt is something I will continue to develop and evolve as time goes by. But as any web project manager will tell you, the more you plan, the more chance there is your project will be successful and the same goes for estimating times.

When possible, resisting the temptation to throw some figures onto a proposal and send it off and instead splitting the project requirements into as granular detail as possible can really be a life saver. It not only identifies possible grey areas early on but forces you to think through everything you’re planning on offering the client and to what extent/scope.

It also presents you to the client as someone, or as an agency, who are very meticulous, diligent and thorough in how they approach things and this is often taken as a signifier of how you will approach the rest of the project and this always gives the client confidence.

Finally, by creating and maintaining a consistent pattern of high-level phases and tasks between your web project time estimates and time tracking means you can collect and analyse reliable data from multiple projects that can help you further increase the accuracy of, and cut the time needed to create, estimates for web projects.





### Roles & Responsibilities

CLIENT TASKS AND REVISION TIME
One thing your granular project breakdown will often not include, because it’s not something you need to estimate on in order to produce a quote, is the tasks the client must complete throughout the project and the revision mini-stages you have to expect to go through before sign-off of any phase or task. At this stage you need to include them, not only for your sake but also the clients’.

This means adding tasks such as:

Client homepage design review
Homepage design revisions
Client homepage design sign-off
Client copywriting
Despite these tasks being either encapsulated in your quote as ‘Homepage design’, or not at all (client copywriting), when producing a project schedule it is crucial to consider them all as they impact the overall project timeline. For example, if you have determined you only have 3 days to complete the homepage design phase, by adding in review and revision times you can communicate to the client that, in order to hit the deadline and keep the project on schedule, they must be available to review, provide feedback, sign-off and deliver website copy on/by certain dates.

Often a client seeing the turnaround time required from them, when comparing with their busy schedule, can illustrate the realism of hitting their go-live date and open up an adult dialogue that will see an extension allowed.

Note that this is still before you have put pen to paper and started a sitemap or designing the homepage – this is hardcore client expectation setting right at the beginning of the project and in the right way, as opposed to 2 weeks before go live when print campaigns have been booked!

WHY GANTT CHARTS WORK FOR ME
GANTT charts are the subject of much debate in the project management world, some people love them and some hate them. You will find endless conversations online arguing how they are old fashioned and enforce a Waterfall methodology.

I am by no means saying they are the ultimate solution and you should never move away from them, all I am saying here is that at this moment in time they work for me on the kinds of projects I work on currently.

They allow me to:

Explain the web project lifecycle to the client
Schedule a realistic timeline with milestones that are visible to everyone
Communicate to the client their level of involvement and when they need to be available
Track the project’s progress at a low-level
Quickly adjust the project schedule and produce new milestone dates if anything overruns
Highlight the fact I need to secure more resource in order to meet the original dates
Need I sell it more? This stuff sells itself…

So you’ve gone through this, sometimes painfully slow and methodical, web project planning process – how does it help you?

Cast your mind back to the advantages of planning defined in Part 1 of this article and see how this approach has satisfied each point:

Define and manage the project scope
Completed and possible through granular project breakdown
Identify and minimise risks to the project
Completed through granular project breakdown, assumption listing and scheduling
Break the allocated project time into manageable phases and tasks
Completed through granular project breakdown
Determine realistic milestones and client-side deadlines
Completed through project scheduling
Track progress and control the project
Possible with an easily updatable project schedule and consistent time tracking tasks
Secure the necessary resource
Easy to identify using an easily updateable schedule
Being able to manage these fundamental web project management factors greatly increases your chances of delivering on budget and on time without having to compromise on quality which equals happy you and happy client!

When working in a busy environment, as either a web agency team member or as a freelancer, where delivery is what gets you paid, justifying a non-production / non-billable day or two to plan the project is pretty hard to do. Some people know it should be done and just can’t carve out the time, others don’t really believe planning in that much detail is necessary.

Those that can’t find the time should probably try to track the time they spend during their projects working on tasks that they wouldn’t have to if they had planned first – usually this time is much greater than the time it would’ve taken to plan.

Those that don’t believe planning in detail is necessary have probably had a few successes where a project was bought in on time and on budget without a planning stage, or are just avoiding admitting the fact that they don’t enjoy planning. Admitting you don’t enjoy planning is fine, not everyone does, but while admitting this, please try to also admit how many projects have not been delivered on time or budget that perhaps could’ve been if only you’d planned thoroughly.

Always skipping web project planning is a hit and miss affair where success is more dependent on the project and client rather than your ability as a web project manager.

Consistent and thorough web project planning generally results in a more consistent success rate with web projects because, before production begins, you are able to identify, define, and thus manage the critical parts of any project; phases, tasks, resource, timelines, milestones and risks and communicate these to the client.

Thorough web project planning does not ensure a project will come in on time or on budget, but it does increase the chances, and if over budget and late, it will also limit the extent the project overruns because while you may have missed or underestimated a few tasks or risks at the planning stage, you will have identified many more that you have managed to successfully control – and anything you missed this time, you can easily make sure you don’t the next time.

To the web project managers out there, some of the advantages and methods described in this article will be nothing new, but, to web agency and freelance guys and girls with little web project management and planning experience, I hope it explains why planning web projects is so important, to both supplier and client.

But primarily I hope it shows that planning a web project is not a dark art that should only be tackled by dedicated web project managers, it’s something anyone can do as long as you can mentally envisage the project from start to finish…

The real dark art is actually being able to determine the appropriate level of planning that should be undertaken for each project and then managing the project to that plan once in full swing!

n element of one of my recent Smashing Magazine articles, Guidelines for Successful Communication with Clients, proved to be of particular interest to a lot of readers, the weekly web project status report for clients.

So here’s a little (well, a lot) more on why they work, what should be in them and a few tips on producing them.

WHY A WEEKLY WEB PROJECT REPORT?
Well first of all it should be said that a web project report does not necessarily have to be compiled and sent to the client on a weekly basis, however I believe this only applies to large projects with big budgets that are spanning over more than six months, but even then the web project report should be sent out once every other week at least!

But let’s assume we’re all talking about your bog standard website or web application project (if there is such a thing), isn’t sending a weekly web project a little too over the top?

Well quite frankly, no.

I’ve lost count of the number of times this approach has made certain conversations with clients infinitely easier, which I’ll explain below, but there are other beneficial reasons too.

CONVEYS PROFESSIONALISM
When it comes to web industry (or any industry for that matter) there are varying quality levels amongst us suppliers, some great and some absolute cowboys – a key part of maturing as a business is to make clients feel looked after to the point where they give you repeat business and referrals to others.

A 1970's style photograph of a man with an oversized foam cowboy hat on sitting on the sofaI’ll build you a website pilgrim
Achieving these key points come from a multitude of factors but consistently coming across as professional when it comes to web project management is one of the most important.

You can deliver the most amazing looking or functionally cutting edge product to your client, but if the road to that delivery leaves the client feeling anything less than 100% confident in your approach to business in general, they could very well think twice before giving you more work or staking their reputation with peers by recommending you.

You’d be surprised how organised ‘paperwork’ (or lack thereof) can influence a client’s impression of you – weekly web project reports contribute to that professional approach that is not only beneficial for you but also your agency.

INTERNAL WEB PROJECT STATUS COMMUNICATION
As you’re going to all that trouble of compiling this ‘easy to digest’ web project report, why not send it to your boss and project team also. By all rights it will contain exactly the information both of them should be interested in and you need to keep them regularly updated on.

HIGHLIGHTS ISSUES
For anyone involved in running web projects you know that on a daily basis any number of issues can rear their ugly head no matter how well it was planned. The weekly web project report can highlight these issues and instigate the conversations that need to happen in order to find a solution.

One benefit of this approach is that all issues are collected and communicated at one time rather than via several conversations at different times and by different means. This is often a more efficient way of dealing with issues and has the added bonus of acting as a high-level ‘in writing’ web project issue log that both you and the client can be held accountable for.

WEB PROJECT SCHEDULE VISIBILITY
It should go without saying why everyone involved in a web project would want a regularly updated understanding of if it’s ahead, on or behind schedule and why. But all too often I see one or two project schedules created (as I described in Part 3 of my Pragmatic Web Project Planning series), in the proposal and for the kick-off meeting, and that’s it for a while – this is a mistake.

What often happens next is milestones are dated, the work begins and the schedule is not communicated again to the client until the first milestone is approaching, which could be weeks from the start of the project – and as we all know, a lot can happen in web projects on a daily basis, let alone weeks.

There are clear benefits to providing a weekly schedule update for agency and client alike.

For both parties it provides the obvious view into the status of the project’s progress and allows decisions to be made on a regular basis that allows for the smoothest path to completion, including needing to secure more resource or de-prioritise requirements to stay on track.

But crucially for the agency and client, a weekly update will aid any conversations that need to be had with regards to schedule revisions, as opposed to ringing the client weeks after starting and trying to explain why you need an extension to a particular phase or task.

As with web project budgets discussed below, if a client is updated on a weekly basis, any changes to the initial project schedule are far easier to sell if they’ve been fully aware of the road that led to this request.

WEB PROJECT BUDGET VISIBILITY
The web project budget update again is pretty self-explanatory and project management 101, but the real benefit of providing regular budget updates is best seen when, like with schedule, budget revisions are needed.

Again, you’ll find it far easier to negotiate additional funding if the client has received a weekly update on budget and was always kept informed of any phases or tasks that were potentially running over, and why – as opposed to if you get to 90% of your design budget after allowing more changes than you wanted and then suddenly drop the “we need more money” line.

With web project schedules and budgets, the key thing to understand is at the start of a project they should both be thought of as ‘initial’ and that only at the end of the project will you know the actual!

Its how you navigate to those ‘actual’ numbers, how happy the client is at the end and how effective your solution has been that really are the true measures of a successful web project.

I’ve witnessed web projects where the solution was delivered a week or two late and only a little over budget, but where the client was left feeling thoroughly in the dark and unloved and thus it felt like a failed project.

However I’ve also seen instances where timelines overran by months and budgets doubled, but because the client had been kept well in the loop and understood along the way why these situations had happened, they were happy bunnies by the end and this was a successful project.

ACTIONS ENCOURAGE MOMENTUM AND ACCOUNTABILITY
Part of the weekly web project report should be actions. This part will list actions for both agency and client, at a high-level, which were completed in the previous week, and actions for both parties to be completed in the following week.

The reason for including actions is simply for web project momentum and accountability.

By this I mean that although a web project schedule may have been produced that has a zillion tasks on it, many clients will be busy with other work and a short list of ‘things they need to do this week’ can be a handy tool for them.

As well as a makeshift to do list, these action lists can also serve as conversations linked to the web project schedule, for example, if in one weekly report a client has an action to deliver content to you and fails to do so and you know this affects the schedule, you can point to specific un-completed actions as causes for slips – again, this transparency and communication helps you out too!

FORCES GOOD WEB PROJECT MANAGEMENT PRACTICE
As busy chainsaw juggling Web Project Managers, one of our constant challenges is sticking to processes when time is short. At times like this it’s all too easy to cut corners and the weekly report is understandably one of the first things deemed as not critical.

A photograph of a man in a shirt and trousers juggling three handheld food blenders lit by a stage spotlight in front of a red stage-like curtainSome Web Project Managers like to exaggerate
However discipline is something that separates average web project managers from great ones.

Not only will the weekly report prove its weight in gold when things don’t go to plan, it also forces the web project manager to keep an eye on every project they’re running and trust me, to effectively stay on top of the multitude of projects you’re likely to have on at any one time you really have to be aware of the most minute detail on a regular basis.

The weekly report forces you to catch up with everyone and analyse the numbers when without you may take the “I’ll review it next week” approach and then one week becomes two – and then the earth falls in on itself and suddenly you’ve lost control of the project.

…and if you don’t believe it’s possible to lose control of a web project a little bit by taking your eye off the ball just for a week or two, you’re sorely mistaken!

WEEKLY WEB PROJECT STATUS REPORT CONTENTS
From the previous section it should be somewhat clear as to what should be included in a weekly web project report, but below is an example list of contents.

Client, web project name, date range the report covers
Actions completed last week
Actions to be completed this week
Web project schedule update
Web project budget update
Complete budget and broken budget down by phase
Questions, comments
Remember, these reports can be delivered in any format you feel is appropriate – some like to use a slide deck or PDF template, but you may find a message template on Basecamp or e-mail template work just as well.

As long as the format remains consistent and clear you’re all good to go!

PRODUCING WEEKLY WEB PROJECT REPORTS
There are many reasons why keeping disciplined enough to produce weekly web project status reports can be a complete ball ache and so below are a few tips that may help you.

YOU DON’T HAVE TO CREATE THE REPORT YOURSELF
Many Web Project Managers have executives or support staff, use them. You setup the template, you create and send the first three or four, but after that there is no reason why a competent executive couldn’t be the ones to dig out the data for you leaving you to adjust schedules, polish up and send on.

ADAPT PER CLIENT
All clients are different and as with web project management approaches, they’ll all react differently to methods of communication and you have to adapt accordingly.

While the fundamentals of the weekly report shouldn’t be changed too much, the way it’s written and delivered should match what you feel the client will be most responsive too. For example, if your client isn’t a ‘details person’ avoid lengthy reports, or if they’re not technical at all, make sure to not include technical web jargon as much as possible.

Adaptation also extends to how you deliver the report, some clients will be happy to just receive it in an e-mail with a short summary, whereas others respond better to the report and quick call to go through it.

Personally I’ll call the client for the first few and then just send through thereafter, unless there are specific elements I’d like to talk to them about.

The important thing is that the client doesn’t see the e-mail arrive in their Inbox, or meeting request reminder pop-up and groan, but instead feel like they’re receiving a professional service and the information included is important.

DON’T DROP BOMBSHELLS IN REPORTS
Although weekly web project reports are the place to capture vital things such as project and budget updates, make sure you don’t let the client find out these facts from the report alone. If any time I feel the total, or phase budget is at risk of overrun, or the schedule is slipping and needs revision, I’ll speak to the client when I realise and not surprise them in the report.

SUMMARY
Producing and sending weekly web project status reports to clients seems like an obvious one, and something many of us start out doing at the beginning of a web project, but as the workload builds up and other projects on your plate are starting or ending, it can often fall by the wayside. This might not seem to be a problem in the short term, but it will become one the minute something doesn’t go according to plan.

From the very beginning it’s important to remain disciplined and send your client a report every week. In this report you should highlight key information such as actions completed, actions to do, schedule and budget updates.

RECORD YOUR WEB PROJECT MANAGEMENT MEETINGS
- May 3, 2011 - by thesambarnes, in Digital Project Management, with 19 comments -

For once I’m just going to share something I’ve been doing for years that I could now not imagine not doing… dressing up as Princess Leia from Return of the Jedi and re-enacting the ‘lying in front of Jabba’ scene all chained up n stuff.

A picture of toy version of Jabba the Hutt and Princess Leia from a Return of the Jedi sceneAwwwwww, look at cuddly lil Jabba
Ok now that confession is out of the way, I’d also like to let you know how using a digital voice recorder in web project management meetings has proved invaluable time and time again for me when compared to old skool method of note taking with pen and paper.

THE PROBLEM WITH NOTE TAKING
Don’t get me wrong, when it comes to being a Web Project Manager I never go anywhere without my notepad and pen, despite it being a cheap notepad and having never actually owned a pen like a proper grown up.

However there are just some web project management meetings where I get back to the office, look at my notes and realise they no longer make sense as they did in the meeting, but look like a cross between that guy’s tattoos in Prison Break and the scribbles on the wall of a mental case who didn’t leave his room for twenty years before being separated from society.

The web project management meetings I’m talking about are the long ones where you’re required to understand your client’s entire business model, current technical and business workflows and rules, design brief and the oodles of new requirements they have – and all in the space of one or two hours.

Now perhaps I’m just useless at note taking, but the fact is I just can’t remember all that information word for word and got a little scared when I had that inevitable moment we all have from time to time where your eyes glaze over, you see people talking, you nod profusely, but you’re literally hearing nothing.

It was moments like this that resulted in me buying a digital voice recorder – ladies and gentleman, I present to you Excalibur!

A picture of a white digital voice recorder on a wooden surfaceBehold Excalibur – she’s beautiful… innit
THE DIGITAL VOICE RECORDER SOLUTION
Due to my note taking being not great, the primary reason I use a digital voice recorder in detailed web project management meetings is because I want to focus 100% on the meeting and I’m not senior enough to have a PA.

In all seriousness, when I’m talking to a client about their business, project and requirements I genuinely want to immerse myself into the process and really get down and dirty in the details, for two main reasons:

I know off the back of the meeting I will have to probably create a sitemap, functional specification and creative brief and I will need to get the details right
I want the meeting to flow smoothly and be an organic conversation. I find this type of meeting to be brilliantly productive and invariably ends up with both parties getting excited about the web project
Once the meeting is over, I press ‘Stop’ and head on back to the office. I know all that detailed goodness is captured and will be there for me when I need to sit down and write some documents or brief the team – in fact, the team can also listen to the meeting themselves – double efficiency bonus points!

I won’t drone on much more about the why, needless to say the number of times I’ve sat with headphones writing a big functional specification and literally enjoyed capturing a complex piece of functionality perfectly, first time – high bloody five!

ALTERNATIVE RECORDING SOLUTIONS
Of course nowadays digital voice recorders look a little archaic and alternative solutions are available for all you smartphone and tablet people.

A picture of two iOS app icons with a little Yoda cuddly toy face poking out from the bottom-right corner“Clever iOS note taking apps are”
These range from simple voice recorders to awesome apps that let you record a meeting, type notes, draw diagrams, and even highlight the notes and drawings you made in sync with the playback. A few decent ones for the iPad are:

Audionote
Noteability
However, I did try using these and personally found it a little more cumbersome than pen and paper and also made me come across slightly detached from the client, like typing away on a laptop does – but maybe this type of solution will work for you.

NAVIGATING THE EXCALIBUR UNVEILING
Although the theory and practice of recording web project meetings is solid, it’s still a little bit of a taboo when you mention the idea to a client, and to be honest I’m not surprised – it’s not exactly standard practice and there are confidentiality concerns.

But I find, as always with clients, honesty is the best policy and by simply explaining that you want to concentrate 100% on the meeting itself and not note taking, and that it will ensure you capture all the fine detail and enable more efficient briefing and web project documents, you’ll generally get agreement.

In fact clients tend to fall into three camps when they see Excalibur, the:

Happy and understanding type who say “Ooo good idea!”
Tentative but accommodating type who say something along the lines of “Ok, but I won’t see this posted on YouTube will I?” while laughing nervously
Very freaked out type who simply say they do not want to be recorded
The first two types of clients end up not thinking about the recorder 30 seconds into the meeting, and the third type, if you’re smart, you’ll identify before even being silly enough to get the recorder out.

A picture of an oil painting of ex-US President Richard NixonSometimes, recording is just a bad idea
But in case you’re not too smart (like me, trust me I learnt the hard way) here’s a few handy tips on when to suggest recording and when not too.

THE DOS AND DON’TS OF RECORDING
DO
Be completely honest about the fact you’d like to record the meeting, even if it’s a conference call
Make the point to mention you will be discreet with the recording
Name your recordings semantically so you don’t have to trawl through “untitled.mp3″ only to find out it wasn’t the meeting you needed after all
Use your instinct to determine if it would feel appropriate to get the recorder out
DON’T
Try to record pre-sales meetings and conflict resolution meetings
Record meetings where it isn’t necessary e.g. budget discussions
Ever use recordings to try and settle web project disputes
Send recordings to non-employees
Covertly record, ever – it’s just plain wrong and illegal I think
But come on, I’m probably just a bit rubbish when it comes to note taking, and because it’s just not always appropriate to record web project management meetings…

…what are your tips for note taking in web project management meetings?

The ‘rules’ I’m referring to are specifically surrounding the use of Twitter, blog reading, YouTube, Facebook, flexitime and all of the other things that now seem to be a widely expected, and to some extent, accepted part of everyday life in many digital agencies out there i.e. things that many view as a sign of people not doing the job they’re being paid to.

THE CONTEXT SWITCHING ARGUMENT
As a Web Project Manager I’ve heard the two-pronged ‘context switching’ argument a billion times:

More efficient working:
If there wasn’t so much context switching due to meetings and people coming over to me I would work more efficiently.
Reason for poor quality or late delivery:
It’s taken longer due to all of the context switching I experienced.
As someone who, albeit unbelievable to some these days, genuinely used to code for a living, I can completely testify that both of these positions are 100% valid. When you’re coding, designing, or even writing a functional specification or creating a big project schedule – being in ‘the zone’ with no distractions is a must, and distractions are such a pain in the arse for momentum.

Is this the solution? Neat idea, or not practical as not everyone can always help with all queries equally?



However, the point to which I elude to above is that it’s not just coders who work better when context switching is kept to a minimum, but it does seem that these are who you hear about from the most – why is that?

And why is it that having a Twitter client permanently on-screen where Tweets are popping up every second, distracting you unexpectedly from your work is considered to be not context switching?

PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
The only reason I’m genuinely curious to hear answers from people on this is because I personally find having things such constantly open on my screen to be a terrible distraction that seriously impedes my productivity and focus.

In fact I find it worse because it tends to be a more frequent occurrence than someone coming over to me or a short-notice meeting being arranged. If I can see a meeting is arranged for two hours time, I’ll tend to work around this necessity rather than complain about it like it’s some big surprise I wasn’t expecting, as do pretty much all other Web Project Managers I’ve worked with – incidentally these people rarely seem to have Twitter open permanently, even the ones who used to design or code.

Is it that I’m just useless as being able to balance these things with my work focus, or is it that it distracts developers just as much as me but they wouldn’t like to admit it in case this culture is stopped dead in its tracks?

DEVELOPER’S JUSTIFICATION
I’ve discussed this subject for quite a few years with developers in various workplaces and forums, and the common reasons given for this culture being a beneficial one tend to boil down to:

It enables me to keep up to date with the latest goings on in the industry.
Having a five minute break to browse Twitter or YouTube helps me relax.
I can’t be expected to work every minute of every day.
My answers to these have remained fixed over the years:

Is there really any industry news that you or the company will benefit from by you knowing about it now as opposed to in a few hours when it’s your lunch, or after work that day?
Fair enough, but often it seems more like more than five minutes, just saying…
Why not, I do (*kind of)
*Caveat: I fully admit I think I talk more than I should at work, usually distracting my very hard working Web Project Manager colleague, and I also take 2-3 cigarette breaks a day, but you know what, many developers do these things also, on top of the ‘Twitter-thang’.

So is it that it’s simply a case that this culture is beneficial to companies, or is it one that isn’t from a commercial perspective, but is just what we’ve all become conditioned to over the years?

A BENEFICIAL CULTURE OR MERELY TOLERATED?
As an employer or Web Project Manager this is ultimately the big question. I don’t know the answer to this, but as far as I see the point and counterpoints are clear.

POINT
Digital folk are a unique bunch of people who generally have a passion for the industry that exceeds the boundaries and hours of their day job.

A photo of Moss from The IT Crowd in a scene where he’s dressed as a barman saying Yes Miss?Most people just don’t understand us and our ways
More to the point, an employer or Web Project Manager, would rather have people with this passion on their team than those who do not as they’ll tend to go above and beyond, stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies and be more dedicated to the solutions they provide, as opposed to those who see their job as just a job and clock off on time every night.

By promoting a culture where they’re allowed to have Twitter open all day long and read blog posts during work hours means you attract and retain the passionate people in the industry rather than the clock watchers.

Developers can choose when to context switch to Twitter, YouTube or blog posts, as opposed to ad hoc disruptions from Web Project Managers, this timing makes all the difference.

Not permitting this culture would result in the passionate people leaving and a ‘corporate’ environment ensuing, and who wants to work in a corporate environment where every minute of every day is tracked.

COUNTERPOINT
If developers spent less time looking at Twitter, YouTube and blog posts throughout the day more work would get done. If more work gets done, the company is more productive and generally more profitable, which means salaries, perks and benefits go up, not to mention the entire team is trusted more and slowly but surely allowed to run things how they want rather than being micro-managed.

By all means watch videos and Tweet during lunch, and maybe a few times during the day, but abusing this culture really impacts on the perception of how hard you’re working, or highlights the fact that perhaps you aren’t. This in turn de-motivates those who feel they’re working harder than you and to bosses who don’t understand the culture, it re-enforces their perception of you being rebellious teenagers who makez web pagez.

A photo of the manager in the TV show The IT Crowd shouting Standard Nerdz!Bosses sometimes subtly stereotype people
The argument that developers deploy, saying that choosing when to context switch makes all the difference seems to fall flat on its face when you cannot predict what or when a Tweet will appear and they’ll inevitably click through to read no matter what they’re doing at the time.

Each time a mistake is made, delivery is late or budgets overrun, if you cite context switching as being a primary reason, to some this will seem tantamount to insulting given that you visibly spent what seems like ‘too long’ on Twitter during either the early phases of the project of launch week.

MY EXPERIENCE, AGAIN
Having worked with and for companies that both promote and discourage this culture, I’ve not seen any major differences between attracting quality staff and/or retaining them.

The only difference I’ve seen is in the attitudes of those at companies who discourage it, and it seems a little more commercially minded and contains a lot less ‘divas’.

On the flipside, companies who encourage or permit it tend to seem much ‘cooler’ and more akin to the Google and Facebook-esque era that we now live in.

A WEB PROJECT MANAGER’S PERSPECTIVE
It will be pretty obvious what side of the argument I personally come down on, but the truth is that’s down to utter selfishness.

By that I mean, I too love what I do, I’m a Web Project Manager and my job boils down to delivering web projects on time, on budget and to a good quality standard. There are things that happen during every single web project that seem to be demanded by the Gods to prevent me, and everyone else in the web project management world, from achieving that.

I expect it to happen, I plan for it, I fight for contingency budget to cater for it – I do lots of things, and sometimes even consider praying to the Gods, but obviously don’t – that discussion is for another time – but I don’t blame you in any way, that’s just how web projects go.

A screenshot of Twitter use GrumpyPM saying if you spend less time moaning and more time doing we can wrap this project up.Behold the Grumpy PM and his infinite wisdom
But while I’m doing all of this to try and make everything run smoothly, as things start to go wrong and the whiners start to whine, I often grumble to myself and others at how the whiners can complain about lack of time or context switching when they’ve found the time to read every Tweet that day, click through to a few links, read the posts and watch several funny videos – it infuriates me – but – I’m ready to understand…

THE BIG FIVE QUESTIONS
If you’ve made it this far or just skipped to the end like Simon Pegg in Spaced, I’m ready to listen, and I want you to help me understand by answering these questions:

Why do you feel context switching when designing or coding is harder than any other context switching for others doing work that requires focussed concentration that perhaps isn’t designing or coding?
Why do you find it acceptable and possible to easily context switch between work and Twitter, blog posts etc. when you say you can’t possibly context switch for pre-planned meetings and general day-to-day disruptions that happen during the average working day?
Why do you quickly click off Twitter, Amazon, Facebook etc. back to work when you see a manager approaching if you don’t think it’s naughty?
Have you ever worked anywhere where this culture was discouraged? What were the big differences?
Do you believe there is real commercial value in this culture? If so can you articulate what it is?
C’mon, sell it to me; sell it to our bosses, please. There must be some Web Project Managers our there who also stay on Twitter all day and read blog posts etc. Why do you find it beneficial? Or, in what way do you see it as a beneficial thing for your project team to be doing?


## Setting things up

WEB PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND COLLABORATION USING GITHUB
- January 13, 2014 - by thesambarnes, in Digital Project Management, with 9 comments -

Bio picture of Holly Davis
Holly is a Certified Scrum Master and Agile Project Manager at Award winning web agency White October. We’re currently recruiting a new Project Manager to join the team, feel free to get in touch if you’re interested. You can find Holly on Twitter @ProjectDavis.
A year ago, I had never heard of GitHub and now I’m using it on several of my biggest projects and to my surprise, enjoying doing so!

A cropped version of the GitHub 404 page banner showing it's Octocat character dressed as ObiWan from Star Wars in a desert scene in front of a land speeder and hut.It’s worth using GitHub if only for this each time you type with chubby fingers.
It started just under a year ago when I asked my project team what their preference would be for tracking issues, and the developers were almost evangelical about GitHub. I was aware that most of our active projects were being hosted and deployed from GitHub but didn’t realise it could be used for managing projects too!

So, we took the leap and instead of introducing something new into the mix we started using it to manage tasks, releases and bugs.

The results have far exceeded my expectations, i’ve seen some of the best examples of team collaboration between client, UX, developers, testers and PM, even users have used it to raise bugs or enhancements they’d like to see. This is invaluable for the product owner, who is able to respond to clients directly and add enhancements to the backlog and prioritise accordingly.

Using labels you can create issues for “discussion” i.e. we need a comment system, here are the options giving everyone visibility over the options and the opportunity to comment and be involved with the solution.

A screenshot of low-fi sketches uploaded to GitHubIf I was the client I’d totes sign this off.
GitHub wins on simplicity and its clean interface. Even some of our designers have adopted it for presenting low fidelity sketches to the client / team to review. It’s great to have communication in one centralised place rather than across emails and visible to all the team. You can set up email notifications when people comment or tag you in an issue.

It has also given me more visibility on work in progress. In our daily ODI scrums we have even introduced the reviewing of pull requests. This helps limit work in progress by ensuring pull requests are reviewed, merged and closed. If the same PR is there several days running, it can quickly alert you that something is wrong that you wouldn’t normally be able to pick up on as a non technical PM.

However, like any tool there are a couple of drawbacks. I have had to continue using spreadsheets to track time and velocity over sprints, as you can’t add estimates or track time spent on the issues themselves. However you can assign a milestone to tasks within a sprint which will give you a % indicator of tasks completed but isn’t that helpful if the one task you’ve not completed equates to half the sprint!

Lastly, there is no easy way to prioritise issues. For ODI we’ve added priority 1 and priority 2 tags which work well but i’d like the open issues to work more like a physical backlog where you can click and drag issues to prioritise.

In conclusion, I would recommend using GitHub to other Project Managers, particularly if you’re happy to track project progress outside of GitHub and just embrace it for the ace collaboration tool it is.

A screenshot of the Huboard tool showing a Kanban board.Web project management things in GitHub? Developers, you cannot escape it! :)
If you’re thinking of using GitHub you may want to look at Huboard, a lightweight Kaban board which integrates with GitHub issues.

If that doesn’t fulfil your requirements you may find something that does on this Quora question “Which project management tools are deeply integrated with GitHub?”

Not convinced yet? Why not do some further reading, here are couple of other great blog post on the topic.

## Delivery

Continuous Integration makes dev life easier. Happier, better developers and testers. More efficient cycle. Keeps people happy.

It's not about the work that you do, but the work you enable others to do.

Smaller teams can afford to keep goals small and finish them often. Then you can test faster and learn quicker. By working quickly you can make decisions quickly, things flow better, and other teams will be envious. Cut your chunks of work into smaller chunks. Keep going to the minimum. If you can see measured improvement then do the rest of the chunks. If not, you've only lost a day or two maximum. Communicating frequently about what you're releasing makes you feel truly agile. Releasing often not only makes the team look good internally, but improves the end result for users too.

THINK HOW, NOT WHAT
Your product isn’t just a bunch of features - so stop focusing on them.

What matters is not what functionality your product has, but how it works. A sign-up process is not just a sign-up process, a checkout process is not just a checkout process, a button is not just a button, a rating system is not just a rating system. Think about how you can stand out by introducing something that everyone else might have but in a unique way - what you are selling at it’s core. Here are a few questions to answer:

What is needed for your product to function well?
How much can you take away from it without sacrificing the core product
Why will people be excited about it
Glasses have one primary purpose, to help you see. Everything on top of that - such as colors, shapes, sizes and logos - is a feature. Understand when you are working on your core product and when you are working on adding features. The benefits of thinking like this, is that it will help you establish a very clear and precise picture of what makes your product your product. This will help you understand the minimal work necessary to get a valuable product out the door, and why you are adding features when you are.

You will be surprised how much the “how” can help improving your product - and getting an MVP out the door.

SHIPPED IS BETTER THAN PERFECT
The goal of sketching, wireframing and prototyping is delivering great product concepts, not great deliverables.

Nobody cares if your deliverables are great if they’re not finished. And few will care how perfect they are even if they are finished. The only people who may marvel at the deliverables are the UX designers, but they’re hopefully too busy to care about internal documentation. On the other hand, everyone wants or absolutely needs you to communicate the right level of details about what they need to do to make a great and feasible solution so they can ship better products, faster.

If you’ve sketched something on scrap paper that you’re confident is a solid solution that everyone can act on immediately, there’s no value in re-creating it in a wireframe or anywhere else. Just take a picture of it and share it where appropriate. In some cases, you may have to quickly replicate it for organizational purposes, but don’t make deliverables for the sake of it - you have better things to do.

When we launched Perch we were, in most cases gently, mocked for writing it in that language everyone loves to hate – PHP. We were quizzed as to why we were not using a trendy NoSQL database. Our technology decisions however, were entirely sensible. They were based on what we knew to be true – that our target customers would not have Python, Ruby on Rails or the latest database available on their cheap hosting. We couldn’t even rely on them to have up to date PHP.

When it comes to launching your own product, it is very tempting to use it as the chance to do all of those things you never get to do in your day job, or on client projects. At last YOU are the client, as a developer there is little more fun than getting to grips with a new technology, building things with the shiniest tools. However, will that serve your customers well? Will they even care, or worse will your latest and greatest languages, tools and techniques actually prevent them from using your product?

PHP isn’t fashionable, a NoSQL database could actually be a great fit for Perch, however if it isn’t available on our target customer’s hosting then there is no point considering it.

The people who will allow you to build a great business around your product are far more invested in your success, because they use your product every day. In our case customers have built their business around selling sites built using Perch. Often they are not developers, but designers and learning a new CMS takes a considerable investment of time. They put a great deal of faith in us, that we won’t turn Perch into something that they can’t use. They trust that we won’t sell out, or otherwise abandon them and we really value that trust.

Understand what people need

We must begin digital projects by exploring and pinpointing the needs of the people who will use the service, and the ways in which the service will fit into their lives. Whether the users are members of the public or government employees, policy makers must include real people in their design process from the very beginning. The needs of people — not constraints of government structures or silos — should drive technical and design decisions. We need to continually test the products we build with real people to keep us honest about what is important.checklist
* Early in the project, spend time with current and prospective users of the service
* Use a range of qualitative and quantitative user research methods to determine people’s goals, needs, and behaviors; be thoughtful about the time spent
* Test prototypes of possible solutions with real people, in the field if possible
* Document the findings about user goals, needs, behaviors, and preferences
* Share findings with the team and agency leadership
* Create a prioritized list of user stories, which are short descriptions of the goals the user is trying to accomplish
* As the digital service is being built, regularly test it with potential users to ensure it will meet peoples’ needs
key questions
    * What user needs will this service address?
    * Why does the user want or need this service?
    * Who are your key users?
    * Which people will have the most difficulty with your service?
    * What research methods were used?
    * What were the key findings from users’ current experience?
    * How were the findings documented? Where can future team members access the documentation?
    * How often are you testing with real people?


Address the whole experience, from start to finishWe must build digital services with an understanding of the range of ways a person might interact with our service, including the actions they take online, through a mobile application, on the phone, or in person. Every encounter should move the user closer towards the desired outcome, whether that encounter is online or offline.checklist
Understand the different points at which people will interact with the service – both online and in person
Identify pain points in the current way users interact with the service, and prioritize these according to user needs
Design the digital parts of the service so that they are integrated with the offline touch points people use to interact with the service
Develop metrics that will measure how well the service is meeting user needs, at each step of the service
key questions
What are the different ways (both online and offline) that people currently accomplish the task the digital service is designed to help with?
Where are user pain points in the current way people accomplish the task?
Where does this specific project fit into the larger way people currently obtain the service being offered?
What metrics will best indicate how well the service is working for its users?

Make it simple and intuitiveUsing a government service shouldn’t be stressful, confusing, or daunting — it’s our job to build services that are simple and intuitive enough that users succeed the first time, unaided.checklist
Create or use an existing, simple, and flexible design style guide for the service
Use the design style guide across related digital services
Provide users with clear information about where they are in the process as they use the service
Follow accessibility best practices to ensure all people can use the service
Provide users with a way to exit and return later to complete the process
Use language that is familiar to the user and is easy to understand
Use language and design consistently throughout the service, including in the online and offline (non-digital) touch points people use to interact with the service
key questions
What primary tasks are the user trying to accomplish?
What is the reading level of the language the service uses?
What languages is your service offered in?
If a user needs help while using the service how do they go about getting it?
How does the service’s design visually relate to other government services?

Build the service using agile and iterative practicesWe should use an incremental, fast-paced style of software development to reduce the risk of failure by getting working software into users’ hands quickly, and by providing frequent opportunities for the delivery team members to adjust requirements and development plans based on watching people use prototypes and real software. A critical capability is being able to automatically test and deploy the service so that new features can be added often and easily put into production. Following agile methodologies is a proven best practice for building digital services, and will increase our ability to build services that effectively meet user needs.checklist
Ship a functioning “minimum viable product” (MVP) that solves a core user need addressed by the service as soon as possible, and not longer than three months from the beginning of any new digital project, using a “beta” or “test” period if needed
Run usability tests frequently to see how well the service works for users, and identify improvements that should be made
Ensure the individuals building the service are in close communication using techniques such as war rooms, daily standups, and team chat tools
Keep delivery teams small and focused; limit organizational layers that separate these teams from the business owners
Release features and improvements multiple times each month
Create a prioritized list of features and bugs, also known as the “feature backlog” and “bug backlog”
Use an “issue tracker” to catalog features and bugs
Use a source code version control system
Ensure entire team has access to the issue tracker and version control system
Use code reviews to ensure quality
key questions
How long did it take to ship the MVP? If it has not shipped yet, when will it?
How long does it take for a production deployment?
How long in days are the iterations/sprints?
Which source code version control system is being used?
What tool is being used to track bugs and issue tickets?
What tool is being used to manage the feature backlog?
How often do you review and reprioritize the items in your feature and bug backlog?
How do you collect user feedback during development and how is that feedback to improve the service?
At each stage of usability testing, what gaps were identified in addressing user needs?

Choose a modern technology stackThe technology decisions we make need to enable development teams to work efficiently and enable services to scale easily and cost-effectively. Our choices for hosting infrastructure, databases, software frameworks, programming languages and the rest of the technology stack should seek to avoid vendor lock-in and match what successful modern consumer and enterprise software companies would choose today. In particular, digital services teams should consider using open source, cloud based, and commodity solutions across the technology stack, as these solutions have seen widespread adoption and support by the most successful private-sector consumer and enterprise software technology companies.checklist
Choose software frameworks that are commonly used by private-sector companies creating similar services
To the extent practical, ensure that software can be deployed on a variety of commodity hardware types
Ensure that each project has easy to understand instructions for setting up a local development environment, and that team members can be quickly added or removed from projects
Consider open source software solutions at all layers of the stack
key questions
What is your development stack and why did you choose it?
What database(s) are you using and why did you choose them?
How long does it take for a new team member to set up a local development environment?

Deploy in a flexible hosting environmentOur services should be deployed on flexible infrastructure, where resources can be provisioned in real time to meet spikes in user demand. Our digital services are crippled when we host them in data centers which market themselves as “cloud hosting” but require us to manage and maintain hardware directly. This outdated practice wastes time, weakens our disaster recovery plans, and results in significantly higher costs.checklist
Resources are provisioned on demand
Resources scale based on real-time user demand
Resources are provisioned through an API
Resources are available in multiple regions
We pay only for the resources we use
Static assets are served through a content delivery network
Application is hosted on commodity hardware
key questions
Where is your service hosted?
What hardware does your service use to run?
What is the demand / usage pattern for your service?
What happens to your service when it experiences a surge in traffic or load?
How much capacity is available in your hosting environment?
How long does it take you to provision a new resource such as an application server?
How have you designed your service to scale based on demand?
How are you paying for your hosting infrastructure — i.e., by the minute, hourly, daily, monthly, fixed?
Is your service hosted in multiple regions / availability zones / data centers?
In the event of a catastrophic disaster to a datacenter, how long will it take to have the service operational?
What would be the impact of a prolonged downtime window?
What data redundancy do you have built into the system, and what would be the impact of a catastrophic data loss?
How often do you need to contact a person from your hosting provider to get resources or to fix an issue?
PLAY 10

Automate testing and deploymentsToday, developers write automated scripts that can verify thousands of scenarios in minutes and then deploy updated code into production environments multiple times per day. They use automated performance tests which simulate surges in traffic to identify performance bottlenecks. While manual tests and quality assurance is still necessary, automated tests provide consistent and reliable protection against unintentional regressions, and make it possible for developers to confidently release frequent updates to the service.checklist
Create automated tests that verify all user-facing functionality
Create unit and integration tests to verify modules and components
Run tests automatically as part of the build process
Perform deployments automatically with deployment scripts, continuous delivery services, or similar techniques
Conduct load and performance tests at regular intervals, including before public launch
key questions
What percentage of the code base is covered by automated tests?
How long does it take to build, test, and deploy a typical bug fix?
How long does it take to build, test, and deploy a new feature into production?
How frequently are builds created?
What test tools are used?
What deployment automation or continuous integration tools are used?
What is the estimated maximum number of concurrent users who will want to use the system?
How many simultaneous users could the system handle, according to the most recent capacity test?
How does the service perform when you exceed the expected target usage volume? Does the service degrade gracefully or catastrophically?
What is your scaling strategy when demand increases suddenly?
PLAY 11

Manage security and privacy through reusable processesIt is critical that our digital services protect sensitive information and keep systems secure. This is typically a process of continuous review and improvement which should be built into the development and maintenance of the service. At the start of designing a new service or feature, the team lead should engage the appropriate privacy, security, and legal officer(s) to discuss the type of information collected, how it should be secured, and how it may be used and shared. The sustained engagement of a privacy specialist helps ensure that personal data is properly managed. In addition, a key process to building a secure service is comprehensively testing and certifying the components in each layer of the technology stack for security vulnerabilities, and then to re-use these same pre-certified components for multiple services.The following checklist provides a starting point, but teams should work closely with their privacy specialist and security engineer to meet the needs of the specific service.checklist
Contact the appropriate privacy or legal officer of the department or agency to determine whether a System of Records Notice (SORN), Privacy Impact Assessment, or other review should be conducted
Determine, in consultation with a records officer, what data is collected and why, how it is used or shared, how it is stored and secured, and how long it is kept
Determine, in consultation with a privacy specialist, whether and how users are notified about how personal information is collected and used, including whether a privacy policy is needed and where it should appear, and how users will be notified in the event of a security breach
Consider whether the user should be able to access, delete, or remove their information from the service
“Pre-certify” the hosting infrastructure used for the project using FedRAMP
Use deployment scripts to ensure configuration of production environment remains consistent and controllable
key questions
Does the service collect personal information from the user (whether government or public)? How is the user notified of this collection?
Does it collect more information than is needed to perform the requested task? Are there uses of the data that would not be expected by the average user?
How does a user contact a responsible person to seek access, correction, deletion, or removal of his or her personal information?
Will information stored in the system be shared with others?
How and how often is the service tested for security vulnerabilities?
How can someone from the public report a security issue?

Use data to drive decisionsAt all stages of a digital project, we should measure how well our service is working for our users. This includes measuring how well a system performs and how people are interacting with the system in real time. Our teams and agency leadership should carefully watch these metrics to proactively spot issues and identify which improvements should be prioritized. In addition to monitoring tools, a feedback mechanism should be in place for people to report issues directly.checklist
Monitor system-level resource utilization in real time
Monitor system performance, measuring response time, latency, throughput, and error rates in real-time
Ensure monitoring in place can measure median, 95th percentile and 98th percentile performance
Create automated alerts based on this monitoring
Track concurrent users in real time, and monitor user behaviors (in the aggregate) to determine how well the service is meeting user needs
Publish metrics internally
Publish metrics externally
Use an experimentation tool that supports multivariate testing in production
key questions
What are the key metrics for the service?
How have these key metrics performed over the life of the service?
What system monitoring tool(s) are in place?
What is the targeted average response time for your service? What percent of requests take more than 1 second, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, and 8 seconds?
What is the average response time and percentile breakdown (percent of requests taking more than 1s, 2s, 4s, and 8s) for your service’s top 10 transactions?

Default to openWhen we collaborate in the open and publish our data publicly we can improve Government together. By building services more openly and publishing open data, we simplify the public’s access to government services and information, allow the public to easily provide fixes and contributions, and enable reuse by entrepreneurs, nonprofits, other agencies, and the public.checklist
Offer users a mechanism to report bugs and issues, and be responsive to these reports
Provide datasets to the public, in their entirety, through bulk downloads and APIs (application programming interfaces)
Ensure that data from the service is explicitly in the public domain, and that rights are waived globally via an international public domain dedication, such as the “Creative Commons Zero” waiver
Catalog data in the agency’s enterprise data inventory and add any public datasets to the agency’s public data listing
Ensure that we maintain the rights to all data developed by third parties in such a manner that is releasable and reusable at no cost to the public
Ensure that we maintain contractual rights to all custom software developed by third parties in such a manner that is publishable and reusable at no cost
When appropriate, create an API for third parties to interact with the service directly
When appropriate, publish source code of projects or components online
When appropriate, share your development process and progress publicly
key questions
How are you collecting user feedback for bugs and issues?
If there is an API, what capabilities does it provide? Who uses it? How is it documented?
If the codebase has not been released under an open source license, explain why.

What is a product manager? What do product managers do all day? Most importantly, why do companies need to hire them? Good questions.
The first confusion we have to clear up is what we mean by “product.” In the context of software development, a product is the website, application or online service that users interact with. Depending on the size of the company and its products, a product manager could be responsible for an entire system (such as a mobile app) or part of a system (such as the checkout flow on an e-commerce website across all devices).
This is confusing because, in most contexts, a product is a thing you sell to people. Particularly in e-commerce, product managers often get confused with category managers, which are the team that sources and merchandises the products sold on an e-commerce website. So, yes, “product” probably isn’t the best word for it. But it’s what we’ve got, and it’s the word we’ll refer to in exploring this role.
To define the role of a product manager, let’s start by looking at Marc Andreessen’s view of the only thing that matters in a startup:
The quality of a startup’s product can be defined as how impressive the product is to one customer or user who actually uses it: How easy is the product to use? How feature rich is it? How fast is it? How extensible is it? How polished is it? How many (or rather, how few) bugs does it have?
The size of a startup’s market is the the number, and growth rate, of those customers or users for that product.…
The only thing that matters is getting to product-market fit. Product-market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.
Even though Andreessen wrote this for startups, the importance of that last sentence about product-market fit holds truth for every organization — whether the organization is getting a new product to market or redesigning an existing experience or anything in between. It is a universal road map to success, and it is the core of what product managers are responsible for.
With that as the backdrop, my definition of the role of a product manager would be to achieve business success by meeting user needs through the continual planning and execution of digital product solutions.
This definition summarizes all of the things that a product manager needs to obsess over: the target market, the intricacies of the product, what the business needs in order to succeed, and how to measure that success. It also encapsulates the three things that a product manager should never lose sight of:
The ultimate measure of success is the health of the business and, therefore, the value that the product provides to users.
Everything starts with a solid understanding of the target market and its needs, so that the focus remains on the quality of the product experience.
A continual cycle of planning and execution is required to meet these market needs in a sustainable way.
So, how does this translate to what a product manager does every day? That question is way too big to answer here, but as an introduction, Marty Cagan has a great list of common tasks that product managers are responsible for in his ebook Behind Every Great Product (PDF). The tasks include:
identifying and assessing the validity and feasibility of product opportunities,
making sure the right product is delivered at the right time,
developing a product strategy and road map for development,
leading the team in executing the product’s road map,
evangelizing the product internally to the executive team and colleagues,
representing customers through the product development process.
But before a product manager is able to do these things, a couple of awkward questions have to be asked. First, do companies really need product managers? And, if we can agree on that, what are the characteristics of a good one? Also, where does this role fit in an organization’s structure? Let’s explore these questions.
Why Companies Need Product Managers
The role of product manager can be a hard sell for some companies. Common objections to it include:
“We have various people in the organization whose roles fulfill each of these functions.”
“I don’t see how the role would make us more money.”
“Product managers would just slow us down.”
“I don’t want to relinquish control of the product to someone else.” (OK, this one is not usually said out loud.)
These appear to be valid concerns, but only if the role is not well understood — or if the organization has bad product managers who perpetuate these perceptions.
The truth is that, to be effective, the role of a manager for a particular product or area must not be filled by multiple people. It is essential for the product manager to see the whole picture — the strategic vision as well as the details of implementation — in order to make good decisions about the product. If knowledge of different parts of the process resides in the heads of different people, then no one will have that holistic view, and all value will be drained of the role.
Let’s look at two major benefits that product managers bring.
PRODUCT MANAGERS ENSURE A MARKET-DRIVEN APPROACH
The key argument in favor of product managers is that they help companies to be driven by the needs and goals of the target market, not the forces of technology or fads. As Barbara Nelson puts it in “Who Needs Product Management?”:
It is vastly easier to identify market problems and solve them with technology than it is to find buyers for your existing technology.
If done right, a market-driven focus results in long-term, sustainable, profitable business, because the company will remain focused on solving market problems, as opposed to looking for things to do with the latest technologies. A market-driven focus is important because companies that have one are proven to be more profitable than those driven by other factors (31% more profitable, according to George S. Day and Prakash Nedungadi).
This doesn’t mean focusing on incremental change to the exclusion of product innovation. Identifying market problems is about not only finding existing issues to improve (for example, “60% of users drop off on this page, so let’s fix that”), but also about creating new products to satisfy unmet needs (“Cell phones suck — let’s make a better one”).
PRODUCT MANAGERS IMPROVE TIME-TO-EVERYTHING
The second major benefit of product managers is that they reduce the time an organization takes to reach its goals. A well-defined and appropriate product development process run by effective managers will improve both the time-to-market as well as the time-to-revenue.
The reason for the faster turnaround time is that a product manager is responsible for figuring out what’s worth building and what’s not. This means less time spent on the spaghetti approach to product development (throwing things against the wall to see what sticks) and more time spent on building products that have been validated in the market. This approach also sharpens the organization’s focus, enabling the organization to dedicate more people to products that are likely to succeed, instead of spreading people too thin on projects that no one is sure will have a product-market fit.



7 Principles of Rich Web Applications

November 4, 2014 – 127504 views
This is a writeup based on a presentation I gave at BrazilJS in August 2014. It builds on some of the ideas I’ve been blogging about recently related mostly to UX and performance.

I want to introduce 7 actionable principles for websites that want to make use of JavaScript to control their UI. They are the result of my experience as a web developer, but also as a long-time user of the WWW.

JavaScript has undeniably become an indispensable tool for frontend developers. Its usage is now expanding into other areas like servers and microcontrollers. It’s the language of choice for introducing computer science concepts by prestigious universities.

Yet a lot of questions on its precise role and usage on the web remain a mystery, even to many framework and library authors.

Should JavaScript be used to replace browser functions like history, navigation and page rendering?
Is the backend dying? Should I render HTML at all?
Are Single Page Applications (SPAs) the future?
Is JS supposed to augment pages for websites, but render pages in web apps?
Should techniques like PJAX or TurboLinks be used?
What’s the precise distinction between a website and a web application? Should there be one at all?
What follows is my attempt to answer these. My approach is to examine the usage of JavaScript exclusively from the lens of user experience (UX). In particular, I put a strong focus on the idea of minimizing the time it takes the user to get the data they are interested in. Starting with networking fundamentals all the way to predicting the future.

Server rendered pages are not optional
Act immediately on user input
React to data changes
Control the data exchange with the server
Don’t break history, enhance it
Push code updates
Predict behavior
 1. Server rendered pages are not optional

tl;DR: Server rendering is not about SEO, it’s about performance. Consider the additional roundtrips to get scripts, styles, and subsequent API requests. In the future, considering HTTP 2.0 PUSH of resources.
The first thing I’m compelled to point out is a fairly common false dichotomy. That of “server-rendered apps vs single-page apps”. If we want to optimize for the best possible user experience and performance, giving up one or the other is never a good idea.

The reasons are fairly straightforward. The medium by which pages are transmitted, the internet, has a theoretical speed limit. This has been memorably illustrated by the famous essay/rant “It’s the latency, stupid” by Stuart Cheshire:

The distance from Stanford to Boston is 4320km.
The speed of light in vacuum is 300 x 10^6 m/s.
The speed of light in fibre is roughly 66% of the speed of light in vacuum.
The speed of light in fibre is 300 x 10^6 m/s * 0.66 = 200 x 10^6 m/s.
The one-way delay to Boston is 4320 km / 200 x 10^6 m/s = 21.6ms.
The round-trip time to Boston and back is 43.2ms.
The current ping time from Stanford to Boston over today’s Internet is about 85ms (…)
So: the hardware of the Internet can currently achieve within a factor of two of the speed of light.

The cited 85ms round-trip time between Boston and Stanford will certainly improve over time, and your own experiments right now might already show it. But it’s important to note that there’s a theoretical minimum of about 50ms between the two coasts.

The bandwidth capacity of your users’ connections might improve noticeably, as it steadily has, but the latency needle won’t move much at all. This means that minimizing the number of roundtrips you make to display information on page is essential to great user experience and responsiveness.

This becomes particularly relevant to point out considering the rise of JavaScript-driven applications that usually consist of no markup other than <script> and <link> tags beside an empty <body>. This class of application has received the name of “Single Page Applications” or “SPA”. As the name implies, there’s only one page the server consistently returns, and all the rest is figured out by your client side code.

Consider the scenario where the user navigates to http://app.com/orders/ after following a link or typing in the URL. At the time your application receives and processes the request, it already has important information about what’s going to be shown on that page. It could, for example, pre-fetch the orders from the database and include them in the response. In the case of most SPAs, a blank page and a <script> tag is returned instead, and another roundtrip will be made to get the scripts contents. So that then another roundtrip can be made to get the data needed for rendering.

Analysis of the HTML sent by the server for every page of a SPA in the wild

At this point many developers consciously accept this tradeoff because they make sure the extra network hops happen only once for their users by sending the proper cache headers in the script and stylesheet responses. The general consensus is that it’s an acceptable tradeoff because once the bundle is loaded, you can then handle most of the user interaction (like transitions to other pages) without requesting additional pages or scripts.

However, even in the presence of a cache, there’s a performance penalty when considering script parsing and evaluation time. “Is jQuery Too Big For Mobile?” describes how even for jQuery alone this could be in the order of hundreds of milliseconds for certain mobile browsers.

What’s worse, usually no feedback whatsoever is given to the user while the scripts are loading. This results in a blank page displaying and then a sudden transition to a fully loaded page.

Most importantly, we usually forget that the current prevailing transport of internet data (TCP) starts slowly. This pretty much guarantees that most script bundles won’t be fetched in one roundtrip, making the situation described above even worse.

A TCP connection starts with an initial roundtrip for the handshake. If you’re using SSL, which happens to be important for safe script delivery, an additional two roundtrips are used (only one if the client is resuming a session). Only then can the server start sending data, but as it turns out, it does so slowly and incrementally.

A congestion control mechanism called slow start is built into the TCP protocol to send the data in a growing number of segments. This has two serious implications for SPAs:

Large scripts take a lot longer to download than it seems. As explained in the book “High Performance Browser Networking” by Ilya Grigorik, it takes “four roundtrips (…) and hundreds of milliseconds of latency, to reach 64 KB of throughput between the client and server”. In this example, considering a great internet connection between London and New York, it takes 225ms before TCP is able to reach the maximum packet size.
Since this rule applies also for the initial page download, it makes the initial content that comes rendered with the page all that much more important. As Paul Irish concludes in his presentation “Delivering the Goods”, the first 14kb are crucially important. This is a helpful illustration of the amount of data the server can send in each round-trip over time:

How many KB a server can send for each phase of the connection by segments.
How many KB a server can send for each phase of the connection by segments

Websites that deliver content (even if it’s only the basic layout without the data) within this window will seem extremely responsive. In fact, to many authors of fast server-side applications JavaScript is deemed unneeded or as something to be used sparingly. This bias is further strengthened if the app has a fast backend and data sources and its servers located near users (CDN).

The role of the server in assisting and speeding up content presentation is certainly application-specific. The solution is not always as straightforward as “render the entire page on the server”.

In some cases, parts of the page that are not essential to what the user is likely after are better left out of the initial response and fetched later by the client. Some applications, for example, opt to render the “shell” of the page to respond immediately. Then they fetch different portions of the page in parallel. This allows for great responsiveness even in a situation with slow legacy backend services. For some pages, pre-rendering the content that’s “above the fold” is also a viable option.

Making a qualitative assessment of scripts and styles based on the information the server has about the the session, the user and the URL is absolutely crucial. The scripts that deal with sorting orders will obviously be more important to /orders than the logic to deal with the settings page. Maybe less intuitively, one could also make a distinction between “structural CSS” and the “skin/theme CSS”. The former might be required by the JavaScript code, so it should block, but the latter could be loaded asynchronously.

A neat example of a SPA that does not incur in extra roundtrip penalties is a proof-of-concept clone of StackOverflow in 4096 bytes (which can theoretically be delivered on the first post-handshake roundtrip of a TCP connection!). It manages to pull this off at the expense of cacheability, by inlining all the assets within the response. With SPDY or HTTP/2 server push, it should be theoretically possible to deliver client code that’s cacheable in a single hop. For the time being, rendering part or all of the page on the server is the most common solution to avoiding extra roundtrips.

A flexible enough system that can share rendering code between browser and server and provides tools for progressively loading scripts and styles will probably eliminate the colloquial distinction between websites and webapps. Both are reigned by the same UX principles. A blog and a CRM are fundamentally not that different. They have URLs, navigation, they show data to the user. Even a spreadsheet application, which traditionally relies a lot more on client side functionality, first needs to show the user the data he’s interested in modifying. And doing so in the least number of network roundtrips is paramount.

In my view, the major tradeoffs in performance seen in many widely deployed systems these days have to do with the progressive accumulation of complexity in the stack. Technologies like JavaScript and CSS were added over time. Their popularity increased over time as well. Only now can we appreciate the impact of the different ways they’ve been applied. Some of this is addressed by improving protocols (as shown by the ongoing enhancements seen in SPDY and QUIC), but the application layer is where most of the benefits will come from.

It’s helpful to refer to some of the initial discussions around the design of the initial WWW and HTML to understand this. In particular, this mailing list thread from 1997 proposing the addition of the <img> tag to HTML. Marc Andreessen re-iterates the importance of serving information fast:

“If a document has to be pieced together on the fly, it could get arbitrarily complex, and even if that were limited, we’d certainly start experiencing major hits on performance for documents structured in this way. This essentially throws the single-hop principle of WWW out the door (well, IMG does that too, but for a very specific reason and in a very limited sense) — are we sure we want to do that?”

 2. Act immediately on user input

tl;DR: JavaScript allows us to mask network latency altogether. Applying this as a design principle should even remove most spinners or “loading” messages from your applications. PJAX or TurboLinks miss out on opportunities to improve the perception of speed.
The first principle builds heavily on the idea of minimizing latency as the user interacts with your website.

That said, despite how much effort you invest into minimizing the back-and-forth between server and client, there’s a few things beyond your control. A theoretical lower bound given by the distance between your user and your server being the unescapable one.

Poor or unpredictable network quality being the other significant one. If the network connection is not great, packet re-transmission will occur. What you would expect to result in a couple roundtrips could end up taking several.

And in this lies JavaScript’s greatest strength towards improving UX. With client-side code driving user interaction, we are now able to mask latency. We can create the perception of speed. We can artificially approach zero latency.

Let’s consider the basic HTML web again for a second. Documents connected together through hyperlinks, or <a> tags. When any of them are clicked, the browser will make a network request that’ll take unpredictably long, then get and process its response and finally transition to the new state.

JavaScript allows to act immediately and optimistically on user input. A click on a link or button can result in an immediate reaction without hitting the network. A famous example of this is Gmail (or Google Inbox), where archiving an email will happen immediately on the UI while the server request is sent and processed asynchronously.

In the case of a form, instead of waiting for some HTML as a response after its submission, we can act right after the user presses enter. Or even better, like Google Search does, we can respond to the user holding down a key:

Google adapts its layout as soon as you hold down a key
Google adapts its layout as soon as you hold down a key

That particular behavior is an example of what I call layout adaptation. The basic idea is that the first state of a page “knows” about the layout of the next state, so it can transition to it before there’s any data to populate the page with. It’s “optimistic” because there’s still a risk that the data never comes and an error should be displayed instead, but that’s obviously rare.

Google’s homepage is particularly relevant to this essay because its evolution illustrates the first two principles we’ve discussed very clearly.

First of all, analyzing the packet dump of the TCP connection to www.google.com reveals they make sure to send their entire homepage all at once after the request comes in. The whole exchange, including closing the connection, takes 64ms for me in San Francisco. This has likely been the case ever since the beginning.

In late 2004, Google pioneered the usage of JavaScript to provide inline as-you-type suggestions (curiously, as a 20% time project, like Gmail). This even became an inspiration for coining AJAX:

Take a look at Google Suggest. Watch the way the suggested terms update as you type, almost instantly … with no waiting for pages to reload. Google Suggest and Google Maps are two examples of a new approach to web applications that we at Adaptive Path have been calling Ajax

And in 2010 they introduced Instant Search, which puts JS front and center by skipping the page refresh altogether and transitioning to the “search results” layout as soon as you press a key as we saw above.

Another prominent example of layout adaptation is most likely in your pocket. Ever since the early days, iPhone OS would request app authors to provide a default.png image that would be rendered right away, while the actual app was loading.

iPhone OS enforced loading default.png before the application
iPhone OS enforced loading default.png before the application

In this case, the OS was compensating not necessarily for network latency, but CPU. This was crucial considering the constraints of the original hardware. There’s however a scenario where this technique breaks. That would be when the layout doesn’t match the stored image, as in the case of login screens. A thorough analysis of its implications was provided by Marco Arment in 2010.

Another form of input besides clicks and form submissions that’s greatly enhanced by JavaScript rendering is file input.

We can capture the user’s intent to upload through a variety of means: drag and drop, paste, file picker. Then, thanks to new HTML5 APIs we can display content as if it had been uploaded. An example of this in action is in the work we did with Cloudup uploads. Notice how the thumbnail is generated and rendered immediately:

The image gets rendered and fades in before the upload completes
The image gets rendered and fades in before the upload completes

In all of these cases, we’re enhancing the perception of speed. Thankfully, there’s plenty of evidence that this is a good idea. Consider the example of how increasing the walk to baggage claim reduced the number of complaints at the Houston Airport, without necessarily making baggage handling faster.

The application of this idea should have very profound implications on the UI of our applications. I contend that spinners or “loading indicators” should become a rarity, especially as we transition to applications with live data, discussed in the next section.

There’s situations where the illusion of immediacy could actually be detrimental to UX. Consider a payment form or a logout link. Acting optimistically on those, telling the user everything is done when it’s not, can result in a negative experience.

But even in those cases, the display of spinners or loading indicators should be deferred. They should only be rendered after the user no longer considers the response was immediate. According to the often-cited research by Nielsen:

The basic advice regarding response times has been about the same for thirty years Miller 1968; Card et al. 1991:
0.1 second is about the limit for having the user feel that the system is reacting instantaneously, meaning that no special feedback is necessary except to display the result.
1.0 second is about the limit for the user’s flow of thought to stay uninterrupted, even though the user will notice the delay. Normally, no special feedback is necessary during delays of more than 0.1 but less than 1.0 second, but the user does lose the feeling of operating directly on the data.
10 seconds is about the limit for keeping the user’s attention focused on the dialogue. For longer delays, users will want to perform other tasks while waiting for the computer to finish

Techniques like PJAX or TurboLinks unfortunately largely miss out on the opportunities described in this section. The client side code doesn’t “know” about the future representation of the page, until an entire roundtrip to the server occurs.

 3. React to data changes

tl;DR: When data changes on the server, let the clients know without asking. This is a form of performance improvement that frees the user from manual refresh actions (F5, pull to refresh). New challenges: (re)connection management, state reconciliation.
The third principle is that of reactivity of the UI with respect to data changes in the source, typically one or more database servers.

Serving an HTML snapshot of data that remains static until the user refreshes the page (traditional websites) or interacts with it (AJAX) is increasingly becoming obsolete.

Your UI should be self-updating.

This is crucially important in a world of an ever-increasing number of data points, in the form of watches, phones, tablets and wearable devices yet to be designed.

Consider the Facebook newsfeed at the time of its inception, when data was primarily entered through personal computers. Rendering it statically was not optimal, but it made sense if people were updating their profiles maybe once a day, if that.

We now live in a world where you can upload a photo, and have your peers like it or comment on it almost immediately. The need for realtime feedback is natural due to the highly concurrent usage of the application.

It would be wrong, however, to assume that the benefits of reactivity are limited to multi-user applications. Which is why I like to talk about  concurrent data points as opposed to users. Consider the common scenario of sharing a photo you have on your phone with your own laptop:

A single-user application can still benefit from reactivity
A single-user application can still benefit from reactivity

It’s useful to think of all the data exposed to the user as reactive. Session and login state synchronization is an example of applying this principle uniformly. If users of your application have multiple tabs open simultaneously, logging out of one will invalidate them all. This inevitably results in enhanced privacy and security, especially in situations where multiple people have access to the same device.

Each page reacts to the session and login state
Each page reacts to the session and login state

Once you set up the expectation that the information on the screen updates automatically, it’s important to consider a new need: state reconciliation.

When receiving ordered atomic data updates, it’s easy to forget that your application should be able to update appropriately even after long periods of disconnection. Consider the scenario of closing your laptop’s lid and reopening it days later. What how does your app behave then?

Example of what would occur if we disregard elapsed time upon reconnection
Example of what would occur if we disregard elapsed time upon reconnection

The ability for your application to reconcile states disjointed in time is also relevant to our first principle. If you opt to send data with the initial page load, you must consider the time the data is on the wire until your client-side scripts load. That time is essentially equivalent to a disconnection, and the initial connection by your scripts is a session resumption.

 4. Control the data exchange with the server

tl;DR: We can now fine-tune the data exchange with the server. Make sure to handle errors, retry on behalf of the user, sync data on the background and maintain offline caches.
When the WWW was conceived, data exchange between the client and server was limited to a few ways:

clicking a link would GET a new page and render the new page
submitting a form would POST or GET and render a new page
embedding an image or object would GET it asynchronously and render it
The simplicity of this model is attractive, and we certainly have a much higher learning curve today when it comes to understanding how data is sent and received.

The biggest limitations were around the second point. The inability to send data without necessarily triggering a new page load was not optimal from a performance standpoint. But most importantly, it completely broke the back button:


Possibly the most annoying artifact of the old web

The web as an application platform was thus inconceivable without JavaScript. AJAX constituted a leapfrog in terms of the user experience around user submission of information.

We now have a variety of APIs (XMLHttpRequest, WebSocket, EventSource to name a few) that give us fine-grained control of the data flow. In addition to the ability to send data the user inputs into a form, we now have some new opportunities to enhance UX.

One that’s specially relevant to our previous principle is the ability to display the connection state. If we set up the expectation that the data updates automatically, we ought to notify the user about being disconnected and ongoing reconnection attempts.

When detecting a disconnection, it’s useful to store data in memory (or even better, localStorage) so that it can be sent later. This is specially important in light of the introduction of ServiceWorker, which enables JavaScript web applications to run in the background. If your application is not open, you can still attempt to sync user data in the background.

Consider timeouts and errors when sending data and retry on behalf of the user. If a connection is re-established, attempt to send the data again. In the case of a persistent failure, communicate it to the user.

Certain errors should be handled carefully. For example, an unexpected 403 could mean the user’s session has been invalidated. In such cases, you have the opportunity to prompt the user to resume it by showing a login screen.

It’s also important to make sure the user doesn’t inadvertently interrupt the data flow. This can happen under two situations. The first and most obvious one is closing the browser or tab, which you can attempt to prevent with beforeunload handlers.


The beforeunload browser warning

The other (and less obvious) one is capturing page transitions before they happen, like clicking links that trigger a new page load. This gives you a chance to display your own modals.

 5. Don’t break history, enhance it

tl;DR: Without the browser managing URLs and history for us, new challenges emerge. Make sure not to break expectations related to scrolling. Keep your own caches for fast feedback.
Form submissions aside, if we were to design any modern web application with only hyperlinks, we’d end up with fully functional back/forward navigation.

Consider, for example, the typical “infinite pagination scenario”. The typical way it’s implemented involves capturing the click with JavaScript, requesting some data / HTML, injecting it. Making the history.pushState or replaceState call is an optional step, unfortunately not taken by many.

And this is why I use the word “break”. With the simpler model the web proposed initially, this situation was not in the picture. Every state transition relied on a URL change.

The flip side of this is that new opportunities emerge for enhancing history now that we can control it with JavaScript.

One such opportunity is what Daniel Pipius dubbed Fast Back:

Back should be quick; users don’t expect data to have changed much.

This is akin to considering the back button an application-level button and applying principle 2: act immediately on user input. The key is that you can now decide how to cache the previous page and render it instantly. You can then apply principle 3 and then inform the user of new data changes that happened to that page.

There’s still a few cases where you won’t be in control of the caching behavior. For example, if you render a page, then navigate to a third party website, and the user clicks back. Applications that render HTML on the server and then modify it on the client are at particular risk of this subtle bug:


Pressing back incorrectly loads the initial HTML from the pageload

Another way of breaking navigation is by ignoring scrolling memory. Once again, pages that don’t rely on JS and manual history management most likely won’t have an issue with this. But dynamic ones usually do. I tested the two most popular JavaScript-driven newsfeeds of the web: Twitter and Facebook. Both exhibited scrolling amnesia.


Infinite pagination is usually susceptible to scrolling amnesia

Finally, be aware of state changes that are relevant only while navigating history. Consider this example of toggling the display of comment subtrees.


The toggling of comments should be preserved when navigating history

If the page was re-rendered by following a link within the application, the expectation of the user might be that all comments appear uncollapsed. The state was volatile and only associated with the entry in the history stack.

 6. Push code updates

tl;DR: Pushing data without pushing code is insufficient. If your data updates automatically, so should your code. Avoid API errors and improve performance. Use stateless DOM for side-effect free repainting.
Making your application react to code changes is crucially important.

First of all, it reduces the surface for possible errors and increases reliability. If you make a breaking change to your backend APIs, then clients’ code must be updated. They might otherwise not be able to understand new data, or they may send data in an incompatible format.

Another equally important reason has to do with the implementation of principle #3. If your UI is self-updating, there’s little reason for users to trigger a page refresh.

Keep in mind that in a traditional website, a page refresh accomplishes two things: reload the data and reload the code. Setting up a mechanism to push data without one to push code is not enough, especially in a world where a single tab (session) might stay open for a very long time.

If a server push channel is in place, a notification can be emitted to clients when new code is available. In the absence of that, a version number can be appended as a header to outgoing HTTP requests. The server can then compare it to its latest known version, opt to handle request or not, and advice the client.

After this, some web applications opt to refresh the page on behalf of the user when deemed appropriate. For example, if the page is not visible and no form inputs are filled out.

A better approach is to perform hot code reloading. This means that there would be no need to perform a full page refresh. Instead, certain modules can be swapped on the fly and their code re-executed.

It’s certainly hard to make hot code reloading work for many existing codebases. It’s worth discussing then a type of architecture that elegantly separates behavior (code) from data (state). Such a separation would allow us to make a lot of different patches very efficient.

Consider for example a module in your application that sets up an event bus (e.g: socket.io). When events are received, the state of a certain component is populated and it renders to the DOM. Then you modify the behavior of that component, for example, so that it produces different DOM markup for existing and new state.

The ideal scenario is that we’re able to update the code on a per-module basis. It wouldn’t make sense to restart the socket connection, for example, if we can get away with just updating the modified component’s code. Our ideal architecture for hot-code pushing is thus modular.

But the next challenge is that modules should be able to be re-evaluated without introducing undesirable side effects. This is where an architecture like the one proposed by React comes particularly handy. If a component code is updated, its logic can be trivially re-executed and the DOM efficiently updates. An exploration of this concept by Dan Abramov can be found here.

In essence, the idea that you render to the DOM (or paint it) is what significantly helps with hot code swapping. If state was kept in the DOM, or event listeners where set up manually by your application, updating code would become a much more complicated task.

 7. Predict behavior

tl;DR: Negative latency.
A rich JavaScript application can have mechanisms in place for predicting the eventual user input.

The most common application of this idea is to preemptively request data from the server before an action is consummated. Starting to fetch data when you hover a hyperlink so that it’s ready when it’s clicked is a straightforward example.

A slightly more advanced method is to monitor mouse movement and analyze its trajectory to detect “collisions” with actionable elements like buttons. A jQuery example:

jQuery plugin that predicts the mouse trajectory
jQuery plugin that predicts the mouse trajectory

 Conclusion

The web remains one of the most versatile mediums for the transmission of information. As we continue to add more dynamism to our pages, we must ensure that we retain some of its great historical benefits while we incorporate new ones.

Pages interconnected by hyperlinks are a great building block for any type of application. Progressive loading of code, style and markup as the user navigates through them will ensure great performance without sacrificing interactivity.

New unique opportunities have been enabled by JavaScript that, once universally adopted, will ensure the best possible user experience for the broadest and freest platform in existence.

You Are Solving The Wrong Problem


There is some problem you are trying to solve. In your life, at work, in a design. You are probably solving the wrong problem. Paul MacCready, considered to be one of the best mechanical engineers of the 20th century, said it best: “The problem is we don’t understand the problem.”

Story time.

It’s 1959, a time of change. Disney releases their seminal film Sleeping Beauty, Fidel Castro becomes the premier of Cuba, and Eisenhower makes Hawaii an official state. That year, a British industry magnate by the name of Henry Kremer has a vision that leaves a haunting question: Can an airplane fly powered only by the pilot’s body power? Like Da Vinci, Kremer believed it was possible and decided to push his dream into reality. He offered the staggering sum of £50,000 for the first person to build a plane that could fly a figure eight around two markers one half-mile apart. Further, he offered £100,000 for the first person to fly across the channel. In modern US dollars, that’s the equivalent of $1.3 million and $2.5 million. It was the X-Prize of its day.



Paul MacCready holding a “Speed Ring”, a device he invented for competitive glider flying.

Thanks to Alan Kay for turning me on to this story.

A decade went by. Dozens of teams tried and failed to build an airplane that could meet the requirements. It looked impossible. Another decade threatened to go by before our hero, MacCready, decided to get involved. He looked at the problem, how the existing solutions failed, and how people iterated their airplanes. He came to the startling realization that people were solving the wrong problem. “The problem is,” he said, “that we don’t understand the problem.”

MacCready’s insight was that everyone working on solving human-powered flight would spend upwards of a year building an airplane on conjecture and theory without the grounding of empirical tests. Triumphantly, they’d complete their plane and wheel it out for a test flight. Minutes later, a years worth of work would smash into the ground. Even in successful flights, a couple hundred meters later the flight would end with the pilot physically exhausted. With that single new data point, the team would work for another year to rebuild, retest, relearn. Progress was slow for obvious reasons, but that was to be expected in pursuit of such a difficult vision. That’s just how it was.

The problem was the problem. Paul realized that what we needed to be solved was not, in fact, human powered flight. That was a red-herring. The problem was the process itself, and along with it the blind pursuit of a goal without a deeper understanding how to tackle deeply difficult challenges. He came up with a new problem that he set out to solve: how can you build a plane that could be rebuilt in hours not months. And he did. He built a plane with Mylar, aluminum tubing, and wire.



The first airplane didn’t work. It was too flimsy. But, because the problem he set out to solve was creating a plane he could fix in hours, he was able to quickly iterate. Sometimes he would fly three or four different planes in a single day. The rebuild, retest, relearn cycle went from months and years to hours and days.

18 years had passed since Henry Kremer opened his wallet for his vision. Nobody could turn that vision into an airplane. Paul MacCready got involved and changed the understanding of the problem to be solved. Half a year later later, MacCready’s Gossamer Condor flew 2,172 meters to win the prize. A bit over a year after that, the Gossamer Albatross flew across the channel.

What’s the take-away? When you are solving a difficult problem re-ask the problem so that your solution helps you learn faster. Find a faster way to fail, recover, and try again. If the problem you are trying to solve involves creating a magnum opus, you are solving the wrong problem.

WHY YOU DON’T NEED DEVICE SPECIFIC BREAKPOINTS

BY JUSTIN AVERY, 28 OCT 2014 : OPINION

With the ever growing number of different mobile, tablet, laptops, monitors, televisions, watches — and whatever else will communicate information to you visually — it's finally time to put to rest those device specific breakpoints.

Recently I was fortunate to spend some time with Brad Frost. One of our conversations — most of which weren't anything to do with the industry — was around the need to upgrade to the latest round of devices (the iPhone 6 had recently been released).

I was joking about coming across my first iPad (2011 iPad 2) and how comically large it seemed after using the iPad Mini. With so many new devices that were now hitting the shelves and the fact that we're no longer wowed that there's a new bigger and skinnier phone has meant that for some the upgrade to the latest version isn't something that is as vital as it once was.

DESIRE TO UPGRADE

One of the reasons behind wanting to upgrade to the latest device was the need to start testing our own and our client websites to see what we needed to fix.

With the iPhone 6 new larger screen, and it's companions 6+ even bigger screen this would surely introduce a new set of design problems for all the sites we only launched since the iPhone 5 resize.

Surely this, along with the High DPI Screen was going to warrant us to head out and upgrade to the latest bit of hardware.

RESPONSIVE DESIGN AT ITS BEST

The fact is that we didn't need to do anything.

Nothing. Nada. Zip.

Over the past 4 years (that's right, the idea has been around for that long and it's not going anywhere) we've been moving towards a more responsive web. We have flexible grids, we have flexible images, and we use media queries to rearrange our layouts when the viewport dictates.

Over the 4 years we have slowly moved away from device specific breakpoints in favour of content specific breakpoints, i.e. adding a breakpoint when the content is no longer easy to consume.

With this fundamental shift in thinking we no longer have to fear a new device — a new iPhone width — because we've already fixed our sites to work everywhere.

Lets take a look at three of the most common issues with new widths and why they no longer matter.

FORM FACTOR

This is actually a good reason for testing. The size of the phone has increased and therefore the way we interface with the phone will change. Luke Wroblewski has written about the form factor and possible solutions to navigation.

This is nothing new though. There have been larger phones on the market since the Samsung Note was released so many of the issues faced will have already been overcome.

Apple have released a double tap on the home button to move the top of the screen closer for tapping elements, but this form factor is not available across all devices so not something that provides a well rounded solution.

Form factor doesn't matter because you've already taken these screen sizes into consideration with other devices.

HIGH DPI

When the retina display (Apples marketing name for high DPI screens) was released it caused a world wide panic. First there was 1.5 high dpi which meant you needed a 38px icon to render nice and crisp when displayed at 25px. Then we had the 2x icon sizes and we needed a 50px icon to render nice and crisp when displayed at 25px.

At some point we got bored or resizing icons and worked out that if we used Font Icons or SVG icons then it didn't matter how good the screen would become because the vector looks beautiful and crisp EVERYWHERE.

High DPI/Retina doesn't matter because you've already updated all your logo's and icons to SVG and that scales to work on any device.

NEW VIEWPORT DIMENSIONS

For a little while we lost site of what Responsive Design really meant — and I mean the underlying theory of Responsive Design where we respond our content to fit any viewport — and we began to use device widths to target particular layouts towards.

We knew that browser and device sniffing was frowned upon and thought that we could achieve the same approach using only media queries. This spurred the 320, 480, and 768px media queries that kept with the iPhone 3/4 and iPad viewport dimensions. When the iPhone 5 was released a handful of use updated the 480px query to 568px to accommodate the slightly larger screen. Strangely we never looked at Android phone dimensions (probably because there's far too many of them).

Fortunately at some point we all became aware we were doing it wrong and fell back to allowing the content dictate our breakpoints. This has the greatest benefit of all, the ability to still serve our sites content perfectly regardless of the device sizes released to market.

New device size don't matter because you've already based your media query breakpoints on the content.

THE FUTURE

This won't be the last iPhone to be released, and it certainly won't be the last smart phone released with a new dimension.

Fortunately it no longer matters the size of the devices that are coming in the future because we're already prepared for them with our flexible grids, flexible images, and content focussed breakpoints.

The picture proposal has meant that in the future image sizes are no longer an issue either, although we do need to become better at setting the sizes attribute.

The biggest issue we're going to have now will be producing content for smaller screens. Screens that fit on your wrist. This is a problem less for responsive design to solve, after all we can't reduce the content to less than a single column.

Instead the solution will be in the format we serve our content. Making it available not just in between <html>..</html> tags, but also in formats like <xml> <rss> and json.




04. The decline of the website

Have you noticed the gradual decline in the role of the website? Take for example going to see a movie. You know what you want to see, but you don’t know where it is showing.

In the past you would have visited each movie theatre website one at a time to see if they were showing the film you wanted. Each website was different, crafted by a busy team of web designers.

My betting is that is not how you look up movies anymore. The chances are you have a single app on your mobile that aggregates movie listings from many sources. Perhaps you even ask Siri or just Google it.

Web design trends for 2015
Who needs websites when you have Siri?
This creates a much better experience as users don't have to deal with different interfaces. Unfortunately it does start to undermine the role of the designer crafting these different sites.

I am sure it won't be long before you ask Siri and she tells you when and where your film is on. The whole thing done by voice command, no user interface at all.

Content is being set free from design. Instead we are sharing content via APIs between applications and sites. Sometimes business owners are choosing to put their content on Facebook, Yelp or Foursquare. They are abandoning the idea of having their own site. This is something that is particularly prevalent in China.

http://thetomorrowlab.com/2015/01/why-developers-hate-being-interrupted/

Interruptions are to developers what kryptonite is to Superman—they kill productivity and there’s a significant recovery period.

There are two types of interruption: the planned meeting and the one where someone walks over to your desk to talk to you (or if you’re unlucky enough to have a desk phone it’s when the phone rings). The random interruption is akin to walking up to a someone building a lego tower, kicking it over and expecting them to continue from where they were the moment before you arrived. The planned meeting is a lot longer and kills productivity before, not just during and after. So, there are two types of problem that need addressed here.

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A DEVELOPER IS INTERRUPTED?
A huge amount of what a developer is doing is in their head. As we write code we need to keep a mental model of how parts of the application that have already been written and are yet to be written interact with the part that we are writing at that moment. We need to have a solid picture of exactly how the code is working as a whole and maintain that picture. It’s not easy, it requires a lot of concentration and has to remain in place while we think of creative and efficient ways to solve the problem at hand.

Developers can appear very unproductive at times, sitting staring at the screen with our headphones on and very little in the way of keyboard clackety-tap. This however is when we are doing our thinking, when we are building up, adding to and rearranging the mental model of how our code will work. This is the biggest and hardest part of development.

Imagine how it feels to have that interrupted at random by a telephone call or somebody walking over to talk to you. It’s horrible.

This picture explains it very well.

The thing about this mental model is that it takes about an hour to build up from a cold start (first thing in the morning, after lunch or after a meeting). Thankfully that’s not the case after a five minute interruption from a boss or account manager. In that case it takes 10-15 minutes before a developer is back “in the zone” with a repaired mental model and ready to write some more code.

That’s still not great—we only need 4 or 5 small interruptions for an hour to be lost.

Scheduled meetings don’t bring the mental modal crashing down the way smaller interruptions do, but they have a significant impact. We know the meeting is taking place so we can stop where there’s a natural break point in our work and prepare for the meeting. Not such a huge problem there.

Where it becomes a problem is if the meeting is scheduled for an hour or so after lunch or arriving in the office. Remember that it takes about an hour to be in a position to write code after a longer break. Combine that with the fact that nobody can write much code in less than an hour, so anything that leaves a developer with less than two hours is probably going to mean it’s not worth the effort to get started only to stop and have to get started again afterwards.

There’s one more thing, a theory by developer come venture capitalist Paul Graham called Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule. In it Graham posits that managers are on a different schedule to makers and that is the root of the problem. Interruptions are the symptom.

It’s a good article and well worth reading. I feel it’s well summarised by two early paragraphs:

Most powerful people are on the manager’s schedule. It’s the schedule of command. But there’s another way of using time that’s common among people who make things, like programmers and writers. They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You can’t write or program well in units of an hour. That’s barely enough time to get started.

When you’re operating on the maker’s schedule, meetings are a disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in. Plus you have to remember to go to the meeting. That’s no problem for someone on the manager’s schedule. There’s always something coming on the next hour; the only question is what. But when someone on the maker’s schedule has a meeting, they have to think about it.

The upshot of all of this is that developers often end up working late at night when there is no chance of an interruption and we know we can really get stuck into a project. Obviously this is not ideal. Developers are no more able to cope with a lack of sleep than anyone else, especially as we get past our twenties.

REDUCING INTERRUPTIONS
So what practical measures can we take to alleviate this?

Toby Osbourn has written a fantastic article on the subject of small interruptions and one of the things he highlights is the need for developers to turn off the interruptions we create ourselves like having our phone on a stand under our monitor, distracting us with every text, call, tweet and whatever other notifications it has turned on.

Desktop notifications need to go too. Close that email client and get rid of any browser tabs that aren’t related to the task in hand.

Here at The Tomorrow Lab we have a headphones rule. If a developer has headphones on or in both ears they cannot be disturbed. If only one ear has music then they can be disturbed about work. It’s been in place for a good while but for 2015 we decided to formalise it in the form of a poster on the wall, and you can download it to print if you like!

Another thing Osbourn suggests is moving somewhere else such as a coffee shop or working from home. Thankfully here at The Tomorrow Lab we can work from home frequently but moving out of the office is not something that would work for us over extended periods of time. There’s a lot of collaborative work with other members of the team on design, digital marketing, sales and with each other that we need to be in the office for.

The key thing for me though is communication with interrupters. They will never know how they affect our productivity unless we tell them. They spend all day doing their job and aren’t going to find out via telepathy that what they are doing is having a negative influence on how we do ours. Another system we are prototyping here is a timetable or quota of time when everybody has to stay away from developers unless there is a serious problem with a live site. We can’t impose this on account managers and directors so we need to work with them, effectively communicating why such a system needs to be in place and how it benefits the whole company.

That’s all fine for small interruptions, what about planned meetings? We can’t just take a laptop to a coffee shop to avoid meetings we’re supposed to be at. Meetings are a necessary evil. (Granted they are usually last twice as long as they need to which is a separate issue.)

To be honest we’re not sure the best way to tackle this one. We conducted an internal survey asking 4 questions:

What time(s) of day do you feel most productive?
What time(s) of day would you rather have meetings at?
What/who are the worst interruptions you have to deal with?
Anything else you want to say on the subject of being interrupted?
The initial feedback would suggest we’re not going to keep everyone happy when scheduling meetings but there are some “hotspot” times i.e. times you don’t dare touch when organsing a meeting. These hotspot times are in addition to the first couple of hours in the morning and after lunch. On top of that we aren’t robots working in The Tomorrow Lab so we each have different start times and lunch times.

I think the best we can hope for is that nobody ends up feeling like they’re always in meetings right when they are most likely to solve a hard problem.

HOW TO DEAL WITH INTERRUPTIONS WHEN THEY HAPPEN
We’re talking about short interruptions here, the unplanned type. They will happen—hopefully less than before—but they will happen, and the aim when dealing with them is to preserve the structural integrity of the mental model as much as possible.

First of all split up the main problem into a list of smaller tasks, so instead of thinking something like, “Now where was I with the progressively enhanced accessible modal dialogue”, it’s more like, “Now where was I with updating the aria-hidden attribute”.

Secondly learn how to answer the interrupter with something polite along the lines of, “I can’t look at it right now, send me an email to remind me and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.” People will soon learn there’s not much point in interrupting you when they’ll just be going back to their desk to type out the same thing they were trying to tell you.

SUMMARY
Interruptions are a serious problem, they cause a huge amount in lost productivity, ergo money, and can make it very hard to get anything done. Working in a company where interruptions are guaranteed and nothing can be done about it is very demoralising. On the other hand, working in a company (*cough* like Tomorrow Lab *cough*) where you’re left to get on with your work is fantastic. It makes a developer feel like they can achieve something, it makes us look forward to going into work, it makes us feel fulfilled at the end of each day.

Developers don’t wear headphones because we enjoy music more than anyone else, it’s because headphones shut everything out and give us the mental space we need to build a very complicated model. (A lot of us view open plan offices as the worst invention of the 20th century!)

If you’re an interrupter and you get a terser response than you might have expected please don’t take it personally. We’re just aware of the model starting to loosen at the more precarious points and are getting frantic about the need to get back at work.

If you’re a developer and you’ve discovered some novel or interesting ways to reduce and/or deal with interruptions, please let us know in the comments.


http://sixrevisions.com/git/why-you-should-use-git/

Ever since version control systems such as Git have become widely-known and well-used, modern development processes have radically changed.

Here are some reasons why Git has the power to improve your development workflow.


Git Encourages Modularization
In even the smallest development projects, developers are often required to work on multiple components in parallel. Feature X, bug #102, a new UI for a sign-up form, etc.

Among many others, here are a couple of major issues with projects that aren’t version-controlled:

Project dependencies will be painful to manage. Team members must sort out which changes affect which components.
Unfinished and experimental code will mix-in with production-ready code. Without version control, there is a huge chance that an unstable piece of code gets deployed to a production environment.
Imagine these scenarios.

Your client tells you that they don’t want feature X anymore.

Or what if you find that feature Y — an experimental feature you have been working on — can’t be implemented?

How do you get code removed safely from your code base?

Using branches is the solution to these commonplace development problems. Although Git wasn’t the version control system (VCS) that introduced the concept of branching, it’s the first of its kind that makes it user-friendly.

Git Encourages Creativity and Experimentation
Git branching will improve your code-quality and productivity. It facilitates creativity and experimentation by removing your fear that the current version of the project will be affected while you are trying out ideas, giving you an environment where you can confidently explore and develop your project’s future features.

With Git, you can even create multiple branches that approach a given problem in different ways, test each of them with your master branch (the most current version of your project), and then choose the best option.

Git Allows You to Undo Your Mistakes
In Git, you can undo almost everything.

Being able to undo things gives your team the courage to try out ideas and concepts without the risk of breaking stuff, which in turn fosters a culture of innovation.

Git Makes Your Progress Clear
A commit in Git refers to the act of recording changes you have made in your source code.

When used properly, Git makes it easy to craft very granular commits. You can see what changes have occurred down to the microscopic level: Git will tell you what characters and lines in your source code have been altered. If you want to compare two versions of a file or the difference between two of your commits, you can issue Git’s diff command, which will highlight the differences between them.

A side note when using commits: As a good version control policy, I recommend that each commit should only contain changes that belong to a single topic.

For instance, if you’re fixing a specific bug — let’s call it bug #200 — that requires multiple source code changes across several files, all those changes should be under one commit in order for you to easily track changes to your project related to that bug. This way, you can document that "commit X fixed bug #200". A side benefit of this commit policy is, when you encounter another bug similar to bug #200 somewhere else in your project months from now, you can review how you resolved the first bug.

Mixing different topics in one commit makes it hard to see what things were added or resolved.

Also, multi-topic commits makes it more difficult to roll back to a previous version if you ever find the need to do so. Imagine a commit that contains changes for both feature A and feature B. If you find out later on that you introduced a severe security leak with feature B, you’ll have to roll back the code for both topics just to get rid of the problem.

You Can Work Offline
A lot of companies underestimate the benefits that can be had if their developers were to be able to work offline.

Being able to code on your laptop without having to connect to your company’s servers is not only about being able to work during a commute or while at home (which a lot of companies don’t permit due to security restrictions).

More importantly, being able to work offline makes you more fail-safe as a team: While with a VCS like Subversion or CVS, a developer can’t continue their work when a central server goes down, this is not an issue with Git.

In Git, developers can perform everything on their personal computer, making them independent of possible infrastructure downtimes.

Never Lose Data Ever Again
Losing data and not being able to recover it can break a dev project.

We’ve all heard or experienced our own set of horror stories about failed backups and servers. It’s good to know that when using Git, every developer working on a project has a full-fledged copy on their machine, including the project’s complete change history.

And if your team uses a remote source code repository such as GitHub, then the chances of losing your work in the event that your on-site backups fail is much smaller.

If your backups break down, losing data isn’t even a possibility when using Git: Just take any team member’s local repository and restore in minutes.

How to Use Git Today
Git has stepped out of being a technology for early-adopters. Today, more and more developers are using it to improve the quality of their code and workflow.
