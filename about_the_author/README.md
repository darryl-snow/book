# About the Author

Darryl is a web fanatic based in Kunming, in SouthWest China. He is from the small island of Jersey where he began programming in Visual Basic at the age of 13. Around the same time, the World Wide Web was being rolled out. By the age of 14 he'd designed a built his own website - a colourful Star Trek fansite full of animated gifs and hosted on good ol' Geocities - and has been making websites every since. He began a local web design business at the age of 16 and undertook freelance work on and off for the next 15 years.

Following a degree in Computer Science from Manchester University in the UK, he moved to Beijing, China, to work as a web designer & flash developer. He became fluent in Chinese and also did a 3-year stint as a national TV weatherman. In 2011 he joined internationally renouned digital agency Profero (now Lowe-Profero) where he took on various roles.

In 2014 he left China's tech (and smog) capital and moved South to the “Spring city” of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan, one of China's most beautiful and ethnically diverse provinces. There he now lives with his wife and works part time as a freelance web professional and the other part-time as a brewmaster in his own micro-brewery.
