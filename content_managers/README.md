How To Run A Content-Planning Workshop

Back when my agency started taking content seriously, we invested a lot time in developing a process to produce content. The biggest challenge was always figuring out how to get clients onboard with this new process.
Most of our clients were totally happy riffing on how to meet the business objectives of a project or how to approach the visual design, but they always struggled to get to grips with our process for producing content. We found that the most effective way to get their buy-in was to run a content-planning workshop.
Workshops work really well to get everyone onboard with how to produce content (while also clarifying how to agree on content). By involving as many people from the client’s side as possible in these workshops, you can really underline people’s responsibilities, while also highlighting that this process won’t happen overnight.
In this article, I’ll share the approach we developed to run content-planning workshops with our clients. While you will need to adapt the format to your scenario, you should be able to apply most of the steps.
1. Prepare
You’ll have to sort out a few things before inviting your client to the workshop. These workshops have a few components, so put in the work beforehand to make sure everything runs smoothly and you don’t have awkward pauses during the session.

FIND A VENUE
You’ll want to get a room with a large table and a whiteboard. You could bring the client to your agency’s boardroom or do the workshop somewhere off-site that you agree on. Having an inspiring new environment is always good for the client. Sometimes the client will be engaged, but I’ve been in a few workshops where no one wanted to be there and were constantly checking their email or not taking it seriously. Working off-site might hold everyone’s interest better; it also makes it easier to set ground rules (no phones, for example).
INVITE THE PROJECT MANAGER, PROJECT OWNER AND SENIOR EDITOR
These roles will vary hugely according to the project. Either way, involve some kind of senior manager and someone on the ground who will actually be producing the content. This way, you’ll get buy-in from the top and a realistic plan from the bottom.
Invite a technical person, too, so that they can talk about CMS formatting and any details regarding migration and publishing processes. By inviting people who represent key areas of the project, you are minimizing risk. I’ve been in workshops where someone from legal turned up and effectively redefined the requirements by sharing important legal requirements.
INVITE REPRESENTATIVES FROM DIFFERENT TEAMS
Invite one or two representatives from each of these groups: writers and producers, subject experts, and digital producers. Again, these roles will vary according to your situation. Essentially, you want to get managers from a cross-section of departments, as well as the people who will actually be carrying out the production process that you map out. Be aware of organizational politics and the workloads of the people you’re involving.
BRING MATERIALS
Bring plenty of sticky notes and markers and some big sheets of paper. These will be used throughout the workshop, and you will need enough for up to three groups.
2. Map Your Process
First, look at the production stages that a piece of content will need to go through before it is ready to be published. This generally starts with identifying the key content types (for example, “product pages,” “course summary pages,” “how-to guides”). Content types are not necessarily “pages” as such, but could be more modular components of the website — things like product specifications or staff biographies.
Look at the production stages that a piece of content will need to go through before it is ready to be published.
Look at the production stages that a piece of content will need to go through before it is ready to be published.
Once you’ve identified the main content types, look at what’s involved in taking them from a basic page brief (which outlines what an item of content is supposed to achieve) to a product that is published and maintained.
CHOOSE A CONTENT TYPE
Choose a content type that you expect to appear on your new website, such as a service or product page, a blog post or a course outline. Choose something that everyone can relate to; avoid specialized content types such as legal documents and engineering reports.
MAP A PUBLISHING PROCESS
In groups, map out a production process to get a single piece of content published on the new website. Again, this will vary a lot according to your team (for example, depending on who will be doing the heavy lifting of producing the content).
A simple workflow might look something like this:
Draft content
Edit tone of voice
Review internally
Get approval from client
Optimize for search engines
Import to CMS
Review web page
Publish
Maintain
The workflow will vary considerably from project to project. You might need to account for legal and compliance reviews or technical accuracy, or you might need to specify phases for formatting and publishing content (such as formatting for mobile or converting items into downloadable PDF documents). This is another reason to start with a fairly generic piece of content, and then move on to creating more elaborate workflows for specific content types or sections of the website.
The bias that stems from people’s roles in the project is always interesting to see (which is why having people with different roles involved in the workshop is so valuable in the first place). You might find legal representatives claiming to need four separate stages for legally reviewing every page, while a copywriter might want to break the editing for tone of voice into multiple phases. A concerted team effort should result in a workflow that is balanced, realistic and agreed on.
3. Assign Responsibility
One of the most powerful things about these workshops is that you assign responsibility, making clear who exactly is accountable for which work. Failing to clarify responsibility over content is one of the most common causes for delays. Bottlenecks happen usually because people simply do not know they were expected to produce content or because responsibility has all been put on one person. This part of the workshop should prevent such trouble.
Failing to clarify responsibility over content is one of the most common causes for delays.
Failing to clarify responsibility over content is one of the most common causes for delays.
ASSIGN RESPONSIBILITY
Annotate each stage on your sheet with the person or role responsible for it. This might look something like this:
Draft content: subject expert
Edit tone of voice: copywriter
Review internally: senior editor
Get approval from client: project owner
Optimize for search engines: SEO editor
Import to CMS: CMS editor
Review web page: project owner
Publish: CMS editor
Maintain: subject expert
IDENTIFY LACK OF OWNERSHIP
Mark any stages that don’t have a clear owner. This is often a huge revelation. “We need to hire an SEO editor!” “We need a copywriter!” “We need a pastry chef!” By simply highlighting the parts of the process for which no one is responsible, you’ll quickly see where the challenges for your project lie. By acknowledging these now, you will save a huge amount of stress down the line. You might find that the plan is solid and has no gaps, or you might immediately see that hiring a copywriter will save you a whole lot of trouble. Either way, this part of the workshop is critical.
CLARIFY RESPONSIBILITIES
Ask, “Do the people responsible know they are responsible?” This is another great opportunity to minimize risk. Make sure that everyone knows what’s expected of them, and see whether anyone has too much on their plate. A well-organized content inventory or dedicated project-management software comes in handy here.
4. Identify Risks In The Process
Building on the previous step, make sure the following questions are resolved to avoid bottlenecks.
“DO TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE A SAY?”
Multiple heads are sometimes not better than one for producing content. Keep an eye out for pages or sections of the website that have a lot of editors and reviewers involved. I’ve seen so many projects delayed because content was bounced between editors for days on end, often just leading to over-edited and nonsensical text.
“IS ONE PERSON OVERBURDENED?”
These workshops are the perfect time to assess the volume of work assigned to individuals and assess how realistically they can get it done. Give less outspoken people a chance to air their concerns, which is a lot easier when you’ve estimated the hours of work involved. Speak with each individual to review their workload.
“DO WE HAVE THE SKILLS REQUIRED?”
Is poorly written content a risk? Or could the content be misinformed (due to a lack of expertise)? Will the content be optimized for search engines? Go back to your content requirements and make sure you have the manpower to meet them all. If you don’t, call for some outside help.
“WHERE MIGHT THINGS GET POLITICAL OR CONTENTIOUS?”
It’s an awkward subject to broach, but organizational politics could pose a serious threat to the project. I’ve often seen people hold back their opinion (or, more dangerously, overestimate their ability to deliver work) due to certain people being in the room or politics. The best way to deal with this is simply to treat all team members as equals and to ask probing questions of everyone in the room.
5. Estimate Hours
It might not be easy, but try to calculate the man hours of work required to complete each stage of the process. This isn’t the same as calculating how long it will take to complete a stage, although both are important when planning resourcing.
Estimatehow much effort is required to complete each stage.
Estimatehow much effort is required to complete each stage.
ESTIMATE WORKLOAD
Estimate (in fractions of hours) how much effort is realistically required to complete each stage. Once you’ve come to an agreement on the time required, write the number beside each stage. If the debate about estimates is taking too long, you could try adapting the “planning poker” technique used in scrum.
CALCULATE TIME
Add up the time required to complete all stages. This might be a good time for a break.
ESTIMATE TOTAL WORKLOAD
Multiply the total time by the number of pages anticipated for the website to get an estimate of the total amount of effort required for all of your content. As mentioned, you might be dealing with modules or items of content (things like product specifications or staff biographies), rather than pages. Either way, consider the average size of these items to get a realistic estimate of the time required to get the work done. I often group together additional content, such as microcopy, treating it as a single item in the calculation.
The calculation might look like this: 4 hours (time to produce and approve one page) × 125 pages = 500 hours of work.
6. Present The Process
Everyone should review the process at the end of the workshop to be clear on what’s going to happen, who is doing what and how it will be implemented. This is also a good time to outline the next steps.
WALK THROUGH THE PROCESS
Each group should walk the whole team through their process (on a sheet of paper) and then open up the presentation for discussion. The person facilitating the workshop should go around and get input from everyone in the room. Address any concerns or anxieties immediately. Concerns tend to focus on whether there is enough time! Also, address any technical issues that people might not feel confident asking about.
Try to film the presentations so that any absent stakeholders can keep up with the discussion.
Following this discussion, move on to the slightly more serious task of setting realistic deadlines for the content and assigning responsibility. Talk about the software you might use to host your editorial calendar, once you have a clear idea of the process that the software has to support. Choosing the software first could lead you to have to shoehorn the process in; this is best avoided!
Workshops Work
That’s the process we’ve developed to run workshops with our clients. Hopefully, this template will help you to run successful content-planning workshops of your own and, more importantly, help you to get content finished on time and to a high standard.
With everyone on the same page (literally), the risk of delays with content production will be far less.

The most important thing

The most important thing anyone can do on a web project is find its nucleus. The core, that central piece of content around which everything orbits. Finding that reveals how all of the content fits together. It offers clarity to the relationships between the project’s content and the project’s vision, and will make your process far more successful.

A website is a black hole without content, and finding that core piece saves us from being sucked into the gravitational pull of building fancy buckets to hold lorem ipsum. It changes our center of gravity from a negative to a positive and connects people to people. The web exists to connect us—not to machines, but to each other. Unless the machine is Data, then I’m cool with that.

I help teams find the content nucleus through a collaborative responsive content modeling process that anyone can—and should—do.

Finding this core content will speed up the future design, content and development process. The entire team (vendors, stakeholders, audiences) will walk away with a common understanding and vision. Every time you write or revise, you’ll think about that core piece of content and refocus. The content authoring experience becomes what you it was always meant to be: dreamy.

So. Why model?

We live in a multi-device world and that’s not likely to change. Considering the number of current devices alone is mind boggling. Our content could be displayed on TVs, laptops, iPhones, android devices, Times-Square-type displays, projections, watches, audio devices… and this list grew as I typed.

Don’t you want your core idea—your primary message—to be clear and easy to access on all devices? Of course you do! Finding the nucleus of your content will make that happen. Prioritizing core content will also make it display-ready for gadgets like Google Glass and Apple Watches. Maybe that future device will share content wirelessly from a touch-screen watch to an audio interface in your sunglasses. BOOM—your prioritized content will be in place and ready for duty!

The team also orbits this central content. The process unites far flung members who aren’t sure how they’d work together to make a project successful. When they rally to find this central content, they become bonded by its gravitational pull. It’s the number one exercise I lead that causes that aha moment—the moment people understand how the project will succeed. It isn’t just finding the atomic piece that is the big win—it finding it together.

The right expectations

You *will* find a great solution. Everyone on the team needs to believe in the success of this activity. Positive thinking goes a long way to achieving success. And, honestly, I’ve never lead a session that hasn’t been successful.

The activity will be intense. There will be times when everyone’s staring into space, rocking to self-sooth. Pushing through will bring success. I promise.

The right team

You need people in the room who have the right passion and the right information. Here’s a typical team:

UX lead
Content strategist
Developer
Client project sponsor
Client IT lead
Client content specialist
It may not be possible to have these specialists for every project, but there’s probably people with these general responsibilities in their official (or unofficial) job descriptions. The goal is to involve people who understand the problem, are passionate about solving it, and have the authority to make decisions. A lot will happen during the workshop that will be foundational for future work.

The right foundation

How do you find your core pieces of content and your team’s aha moment? This can’t happen without these few foundational steps.

Step One — Know your content

Inventory everything you have. An audit will give you a clear picture of not only what exists, but its quality and reason for existing (OUCH/ROT).

Step Two — Know your purpose

Knowing your audiences and their priorities
Creating a UX vision for the project
Understanding your design principles
Setting your high-level goals for the site
We have to know what exists to know its purpose and to see patterns. We need to know our purpose because we can’t know what our central content type is without knowing who we’re communicating with and why. If you don’t know who you’re talking to, its pretty damn hard to write for them.

Getting our hands dirty

Having everyone together is key. Sometimes this means being locked in a room for the better part of a week. Sometimes just a couple days. It might look like a jury talking through the most important case ever.

We take breaks as a group and lunch gets delivered. Responsive content modeling is a team-building exercise—with less trust falls and more post-it notes. But trust will be crucial. Everyone needs to feel safe to speak freely, and that’s tricky without trust.

First the who, the why, and the what

So we don’t fall into the trap of letting opinion guide our decisions, it’s important that we establish our who: our audience and their needs.

The UX vision is the big WHY statement we’re striving for. Fire off a quick draft to get it out there and ensure it is pointing the group towards the right target down.

For the City of Red Deer our first draft stuck.

A web first organization that empowers anyone to access City of Red Deer information and services in any way they choose.

The next step is to establish the project’s design principles. These are the guideposts for all decision making during the project. They’re the values or why statements that will keep us moving towards the vision. Think of them as the guiding principles.

From the same project for the City of Red Deer we came up with seven design principles.

Users first
Help users get the information they want by focusing on common user expectations.

Sustainable
Plan for content, technical, and information architecture that can be easily maintained for the long term.

Accessibility
Create content that is accessible for the majority of people (using web accessibility guidelines) and the majority of devices (using responsive web design).

For real people
Engage people through a clear and honest voice.

Relevant content
Represent connections within the community through content related to City business and services.

Passion for your content
Everyone – the public, content authors, content champions – own, care for, and love their content.

Progressive enhancement
Start with the core experience available for all, and enhance the user experience when possible. (Ex: additional columns for wide screen, GPS location on certain devices). Protect the core.

With this framework established, we can dig in to the content modeling phase of our workshop. We’re going to prioritize every content type and as a team. We must agree on everything—no compromise. This is a must.

This is where we focus on audience needs and toss opinions aside. This is the secret to delight audiences and give them what they need.

Content Templates

Here we look at all the content views we’ll need, like the home page, landing page, standard content page, news releases, application templates, advanced search, etc. Often there is an established list based on an earlier contract, and this will ensure sure we have everything we need based on audits, audiences, and previous conversations.

We compare content templates with the vision and goals—taking everything we know about the content/audience/message and begin to prioritize them.

Where will the content live?
Where will the most important content to the primary audiences be found?
Will it live on the homepage or a landing page?
Is this a page where search is dominant?
Now we prioritize the content templates. Number one being the most important. The higher the number, the less important a content type is. Everything must have a priority and everyone in the group must agree (again, no compromise).

It will be important to know how to argue well and speak your mind.

A good resource is Dan Brown’s listening list from his great book *Designing Together*. I introduce it at the start of every workshop.

[edit]Dan shared a nice printer-friendly version of the checklist. Thanks Dan!

You need a strong facilitator for this piece. This can be anyone who understand a project’s process and purpose. The best facilitators are often the experience architect or the content strategist. Remember, there is no such thing as the client team and the vendor team: there is only the project team. You can’t successfully find that thing that bonds the team and the content by working separately.

For a government project I worked on, as we decided on primary audiences, content, and where the content would live, we discovered that the number one content template was the standard content page. Site visitors were looking for information like how to pay taxes or how to register for a dog license. This kind of information would live on a standard content page. Landing pages, listing page, and search were an important part of their journey, but not the information they were looking for.

Looking for the nucleus (content types)

Yay us! We found and prioritized the core content templates. Now we really need to get more granular and find the unique content type that everything orbits—the content nucleus or the atomic content type (Science! #FTW!).

We need list the discrete content types of our content templates: page title, contact module, featured image, teaser copy, main body copy, related items, location, etc. Each content type needs to be written out, probably on a whiteboard, until we’re sure everything is on the list. This may include items that we’re not sure we want included—that’s okay in a greenlight stage like this. We’ll deal with these later.

Step One!

Attach a high level priority of one, two, or three to each content type or item on the list.

One = essential. This view wouldn’t be able to function or communicate the core message without this item.
Two = great to have. These items fully support the core purpose of this view.
Three = nice to have. If these items didn’t exist it wouldn’t have a huge impact on the view.
If you start to label items with a four, they’re probably pointless. Make note, but remove them. Everything should point people towards the core purpose of this content.

Some priority three elements might reveal themselves as necessary and some priority ones could get demoted.Things will shift as the team progresses, but remember that everyone in the group must agree.

Content Model and Sketches on whiteboard

Step Two!

We’re not done yet. Now we go back through the three priority groups and assign a priority order to each element within each group. Be prepared to duke it out, laugh, cry, and sweat through this hard, but essential work. It’s not about compromise, it is about focusing on what’s best for the prioritized audiences.

This is why we established a framework through our UX Vision, design principles, and high level goals. We return to those guideposts for every decision, because opinions won’t move us forward. Considering the needs of our audiences will.

Something must be the very first priority and something must be the last. Try this mantra. EVERYTHING MUST BE PRIORITIZED OR ALL WILL DIE. Okay, don’t do that. But do take it seriously and resist the urge to quit—I promise it will be worth it. This is essentially a less technical, but more human-centered method of content modeling.

Sara Wachter-Boettcher captures this wonderfully in her book, *Content Everywhere*.

Content modeling requires you to simultaneously understand your goals at the highest level and get intimate with your content’s most minute attributes, and there’s a pretty big chasm in between. Luckily, there’s an entire discipline dedicated to bridging that divide: content strategy.

This step is when we begin to understand what we’re working to accomplish. The team continues to set priorities until every content type on this template has a unique priority.

Once these priorities are set, content type 1–1 is the most important. This is your core content type. Sometimes it can be 1 and 2 together, which was the case in the government site I mentioned earlier. It was the page title and the clarity copy on the content page that described to the audience what to expect from the content. Everything else connected to that content type.

These thousands of pages, inventories and audits flow out from this unique content type. This is how new design systems, content systems, and web communications tools become successful, gain purpose, and allow people to consistently find the information they’re looking for.

In a multi-device world where content can live anywhere, this is one of the most important things you can do to make your content successful.  Content should adapt to all platforms and be represented consistently. We can do this by making sure that priority 1–1 content is the first users see on any device.

Regardless of content being accessed on a pebble watch or a billboard with constraints, the fundamental message is as clear as it would be on a desktop. And for the 90% of people who start a task on one device and complete it on another, they’re seeing the congruence of this atomic piece of content and the connections it brings.

Basically, you just became a jr. content strategists. Achievement unlocked!

Sketching

Now it’s time to sketch! We start to draw out the content and interaction patterns while thinking about priority, audience needs, vision, and principles. Keep in mind that priority doesn’t necessarily mean something comes first in a linear fashion. It could mean it has a higher placement in the visual hierarchy.

To make this work for responsive web design (RWD) projects, it’s important to do at least two sketches for each unique content template. One small screen and one large screen. As it isn’t practical to sketch the thousands of possible moments between break points on a RWD, these two sketches won’t cover everything, but they’’ll give your future in-browser wireframes a head start and force you to think in both contexts.

The goal is to keep priorities across all breakpoints that you sketch while representing them with the right interaction and content patterns for each screen size. Congruency in experience and content.

Get it on the web

Get the documented content types into in-browser wireframes to help demonstrate the content priorities and interaction patterns. This will allow us to test it on multiple devices and make sure our priorities hold up—do they align with the vision and principles?


This also allows the design to be informed by the content. As the design continues to progress into visual design, we make decisions based on the content—we can’t do our design work properly without understanding our content. A website is a black hole without content and so is a design system.

Document everything

As you move through each phase, take pictures of the whiteboards, keep notes, and save post-it notes. This will help you move into the next steps and help you communicate the value of what you just accomplished.

Fixing the Web

You too can find the core piece of content and move your project forward while focusing on the the important bits.

The content modeling notes will become annotations on future wireframes, your sketches will be the blueprints for the wireframes. Content authors will understand how it all fits together and project stakeholders will see rapid progress with high value.

People love this process. I’ve had an IT manager stifle a giggle while he announced to the team, “I love this process so much.”

Finding the core piece of content really is the key to every web project, big or small. It will make your projects more successful and build a better, more thoughtful web, one content type at a time.

When it comes to writing the copy for your website, start with a users question rather than the message you wish to communicate.

When it comes to revising the content on a website many recommend starting with an audit. On one level this makes a lot of sense. Look at what you have and revise accordingly. But, on another level this is the wrong approach.

My problem is that this starts from the organisations point of the view, rather than that of the user. It starts by saying, what content do we have that we want to share? Sure, it may need rewriting to be more ‘user friendly’ but it still makes one massive assumption. That users care about that content in the first place.

We should be adopting a ‘question first’ approach to content.

I often see this damaging mindset. Managers who say we should put the brochure online. As digital professionals we might go as far as suggesting it needs rewriting. But rarely do we ask whether users care about the content of a brochure at all.

Instead we should be adopting a ‘question first’ approach to content. This begins with understanding what it is users want to know.

Knowing what questions users have

Gone are the days when people just surf the web. Today they come to your website either wanting to complete a task or get an answer to a question.

Finding out what a user wants to know is not rocket science. You can either ask them with a single question survey or look at their search terms.

A simple survey is often the best way of getting to know what questions users have.
A simple survey is often the best way of getting to know what questions users have.
Also a quick chat with your customer facing staff will give you a list of questions. If you have a call centre team, they are a particularly good source of these questions because they hear them everyday.

Once you have your questions, now is the time to match it with what you have.

Matching content to questions

It maybe that you have answers to most of the questions users have. In that case, by all means, reuse content you already have. Sure, it may need rewriting to more directly address the question, but you have done most of the hard work.

But you will also spot gaps. Places where a user is asking a question that you don’t have copy to answer. This is where you will have to write fresh content. These questions also show the problem with a copy first approach. In the old model they would have remained unanswered.

Finally there is a more subtle problem that needs addressing. For some questions that you have identified the answer will be, “it depends”. Keep an eye out for these questions because they often lead to confusing answers.

In such situations ask yourself, “what is the most common answer?” This should be front and centre in your copy.

A great example of this is a question the Government Digital Service identified. Users wanted to know what the VAT rate was. VAT is a tax applied to some goods and services in the UK. But the rate varies for some products such as children’s car seats and home energy. Then there are some things that are exempt from the tax. In short it is confusing and the answer to the question is, “it depends”.

That said, the majority of users want to know the standard VAT rate. That is why the Government Digital Service made sure they led with this. They want to serve the majority of people first, before going on to deal with edge cases.

Don't get bogged down in complexity. Follow the example of gov.uk and provide the answer most people care about first.
Don’t get bogged down in complexity. Follow the example of gov.uk and provide the answer most people care about first.
Of course, it would be a lot easier to just take your existing content and put it online. This all sounds like a lot of work.

Writing the copy

I won’t pretend that writing copy is easy. In fact it is an area that organisations under estimate. That said, there are ways to make it faster and more fun too.

One local government decided to take a questions first approach and came up with an innovative way of producing their copy. They decided to have a content hackathon.

They dedicated a day to answering as many user questions as possible. They grabbed people from across the organisation and volunteers from outside. They put them in a room together with a constant supply of beer and pizza. The idea was to make the day both fun and productive.

They covered the wall with user questions written on post it notes. Anybody in the room could go and select a question they wished to answer. They researched the answer using existing material and then wrote it down.

This was then passed to a small team of editors who checked the writing style and edited the copy. Later internal stakeholders revised answers to make sure they were accurate.

This approach allowed them to get through large amounts of copy in a short time. But it achieved that while still remaining user centric.

I think in other circumstances this could go a step further. I think you could get your audience writing their own answers!

Get your users writing their own answers

Let’s say you were a charity. It would be possible to use some of your volunteers to write answers. Or maybe you are a university. You could assemble a team of students who will do anything for beer and pizza!

The huge advantage of this is that they know how they want the questions answered. They will also write in a tone that they want to hear.

Sure, it would still need editing. Yes, internal stakeholders would need to review it for accuracy. But it would significantly increase the relevancy of the final copy.

It’s all about relevancy

That is what is crucial at the end of the day. Any copy we put online has to be relevant to the users needs. Too much of the copy on our websites is just there because some senior manager demanded it.

Producing content ‘questions first’ ensures it remains relevant. It also gives you a way of resisting those senior management requests. Surely that makes it worth a try.

http://www.socialmediatoday.com/content/how-important-will-content-marketing-be-2015

Now that we are in the start of a brand new year, you might be asking yourself what marketing tactics you will implement for your brand in 2015. You know about all of the Internet marketing techniques, from social media marketing to building links. However, content marketing has been buzzing as a top-notch marketing strategy for quite a while now, and the hype has yet to fade away. Maybe there is something to this content marketing thing after all?

Not only is there something to content marketing, it will be one of the most vitally important marketing strategies in 2015. Sure, link building and social media is not going away. But it is undeniable that content is the driving force behind building links and succeeding on social—we’ll touch back on that later.

So, exactly how important will content marketing be in 2015? Here’s a breakdown as to why it will be one of the best marketing decisions you will make this year and beyond.

Content Marketing Is Important in 2015 Because Google Says So

The majority of digital marketers are all about pleasing the almighty Google. With that said, it is no secret that Google wants to provide its users with the best quality content that’s found around the web. In fact, Google finds content marketing important enough to base algorithm updates around the strategy.

Google’s Panda update is centralized around ensuring that quality content wins on Google. You might think that you are safe from Panda if you are not creating any content at all, but that’s not exactly the case. In fact, Panda actually penalizes websites that sit stale. Panda looks for fresh and quality content; if you aren’t delivering on the freshness factor, don’t look for any sympathy from Panda.

You Won The Battle With Panda, But What About Penguin?

Even if you are delivering fresh content to your audience on a regular basis, this does not mean that everything is smooth sailing. Google’s Penguin update targets spammy websites, which points to content that is low quality and over optimized.

If you are writing content with no regard for quality, prepare for Penguin’s penalty. Keyword-stuffed blog posts that are littered with low quality links will put you on the fast track to disappearing from the SERPs. Overcoming Penguin’s penalties is not impossible, but it is notoriously difficult.

Stay on The Safe Side of 2015 Google Updates With Content Marketing

Although nothing is guaranteed with Google, you can surely help your case by implementing a quality content marketing strategy. Producing compelling and useful content on a regular basis will keep both Panda and Penguin out of your hair. Not to mention, you will sleep a lot better at night knowing that if an update hits, your search engine rankings will likely stay the same or even improve.

Instead of dreading Google’s regular algorithm updates and looking over your shoulder, plan for a smart content marketing strategy in 2015.

Planning Ahead: 2 Smart Content Marketing Strategies

Now that you understand why content marketing is vital to dodging Google’s penalties, we’re outlining a few strategies to get the most out of your content in 2015.

1. Start From The Top: Content Auditing

If you already have a website that has a little (or a lot) of content, plan on doing a content audit in 2015. Content audits are used to find areas where your current content is lacking. It also helps you find gaps where you need new content. Either way, content audits are essential for stretching your strategy far as possible.

Quick Tips For Smart Content Auditing. Content audits don’t have to be a drag. They can take a bit of time, but keep in mind that they can help improve your search engine rankings while increasing the quality of your content.

Furthermore, audits can help you detect over-optimized content that can lead to penalties from Google. Here are a few quick auditing tips to get your content audit started off on the right foot:

·      Evaluate the length of your content. When you are looking at general website content, aim to have at least 350-500 words per page. If your word count is too short, Google may not index content at all if it is considered as too thin.

·      Beef up those blog posts. On the other hand, blog posts are a little different in terms of content length. This is because blog posts are more about engagement, while standard product and service pages stand as general user information. While a 500-word blog post won’t result in any negative consequences, you will be further ahead to increase that word count to at least 1500. Longer blog posts boost engagement levels and keep your audience on your website for longer periods of time.

·      Consider its purpose. Is your content answering your customer’s questions? Does it provide value in one way or another? If it is not serving a need, it’s time to either eliminate it or add fresh content for an update.

·      Use tools to your advantage. If you happen to use Wordpress as your publisher, you’re in luck. Wordpress offers a free plugin called Yoast that analyzes your blogs and pages for SEO value. If you have yet to install this plugin, give it a go to maximize your auditing efforts.

·      Keep keywords to a minimum. Keywords are still important in 2015, but too much of a good thing can backfire. Use your Yoast tool to determine the best keyword density for your content.

2. Curating Content: Something to Talk About. One of the challenges of content marketing is figuring out exactly what to say. Content curation fills that gap while providing fresh content on a regular basis. While curating content is not a substitute to eliminating your original content efforts all together, it serves as a supplement to your overall content strategy.

Quick Tips to Curating Content. Curating content is on the rise for 2015, and here are several quick tips to get started on curating the right way:

·      Invest in efficient curation tools. Manually curating content can take a while, but there are tools to help you save time. Content curation tools like Scoop.it can maximize your efforts by bringing you the best content on the web at the click of a button.

·      Search social. There are several go-to platforms for finding hot topics, one being Quora. Quora is a community-based question and answer website that has topics relating to almost any niche. You might have to dig a bit, but it is free to use and has a lot of great topics and ideas.

·      Always add your own insight. Although curating content might seem like a game of copy and paste, there’s a bit more to it than that. The best strategy for curating content is adding your own expert insight; be sure to credit your original source, and write out a few thought-worthy comments about the subject at hand.

Content marketing in itself can help you steer clear from Panda and Penguin, but it’s important to do things the right way from the beginning. These quick tips for content auditing and curating can help you maximize the efficiency of your 2015 content marketing strategy.

3.    Content Marketing Conquers Link Building. Remember the link building comment that I made earlier? This is where link building – well, links – to content marketing. Link building is one of the primary factors to ranking well on Google, but building quality links doesn’t happen at the snap of a finger.

The driving force behind link building is content. Although quality content does not guarantee an endless amount of inbound links, it will up your chances of obtaining them. People tend to link to quality content that is relevant and educates.

4.    Content Marketing Drives Social Engagement. If you are like most other companies, chances are that you’re using social media in one form of another. When you think about it, social media is content marketing. Even if you only write a sentence or two, you still have to put thought into your tweets and statuses. You also have to ask yourself how your comments will help your audience, and if what you are saying is relevant.

Not only that, but content itself is what goes viral on social media. Think videos, popular blog posts, news articles, and more. Social media is like a vessel that carries content to the hands of your audience.

5.    Content Marketing Makes You a Thought Leader. Those who invest time and effort into content marketing are the trailblazers of their industry. In order to be a thought leader, your content must be original, useful, and on-point with the needs of your audience.

Content marketing can help brands achieve thought leader status by implementing smart strategies. Publish content on a regular basis, engage your audience, and build a rock-solid reputation with content marketing.

6.    Content Marketing Keeps You on Top of Industry Trends. In order to be a smart content marketer, it is vital that you remain current on all industry trends. This forces you to set aside time each day or week to review hot topics in your industry. Not only does this benefit your brand for content marketing, but it also helps keep you educated about your own industry.

Overall, Content Marketing Just Makes Sense

We all know that investing in new marketing techniques can be a gamble. Even though every industry has its own techniques that work best for marketing, you can almost never go wrong with content.

Those who invest in content marketing can win big, but only if they do it correctly. The kind of content that is important to implement in 2015 is:

·      Engaging: The best kind of content is the kind that provokes and engages. If your content is not stimulating in one way or another, it will be difficult to reap the real benefits of content marketing.

·      Educational: Panda 4.1 has proved to us that educational content wins big in the search engines. Education is valuable, so creating content that educates your audience is key to winning with Google.

·      Fresh And Timely: When it comes to content marketing, timing is everything. Keep your content fresh and ahead of the curve every week. Stale content not only looks bad to your audience, but it can also negatively impact your ranking on Google.

·      Answering Questions: Hammering home the question/answer topic, this kind of content marketing always scores with your audience. Answering the needs of your audience will keep them coming back for more.

Content marketing has been important for branding ever since the days of the printing press. This is no exception to 2015, as content marketing’s relevancy and value only continues to increase on a yearly basis. From establishing a solid reputation, to drumming up social media engagement and becoming a thought leader, content marketing is of utmost importance in 2015 and beyond.
