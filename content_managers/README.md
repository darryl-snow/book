# Content Managers

Your role is the most important, and yet almost always entirely overlooked. In fact, statistically speaking, you probably don't even exist. Or you're a project owner, or a project manager, or a designer, or a developer, with too many other more interesting things to think about.

Web projects are content. The content informs the design and the functionality. It *is* the user experience. It must be useful, usable, well structured, and easily found. No matter what role you are undertaking in the project, you are dealing with content. Therefore not considering exactly what you want to communicate to the users and how you want to communicate it dooms the project to failure from the start. Content needs to be tailored for each project based on the project's goals and it's potential user base. Gone are the days of websites simply being online brochures. Younger generations have grown up with the web and are accustomed to engaging with a different kind of content on the web. The way someone might interact with a physical pamphlet and an online marketing site are completely different. What we're talking about here is called “content strategy”. It's about the planning, creation, delivery, and maintenance of a web project's content.

You may have heard of the “content first” approach to web project management. This is a fairly nebulous term that seems to imply that someone, whether on your team or the project owner's team, sits in a corner somewhere and pumps out a load of text and images that can be used instead of good ol' 'Lorem ipsum' placeholder text and grey boxes right from the start. This will at least make the initial design work appear more realistic but it doesn't really drive the design and development process as it should. It emphasises early content delivery, but doesn't emphasise the importance of content in shaping the ideas about the design and functionality.

Paul Boag writes about a “question first” approach that sounds much more sensible. Start with questions, then go onto analysis, then ideas. We need to understand what the users of this project are going to want to know and do. Finding this out might involve market research, analysing analytics data or similar products, even online surveys. A great way to try and understand the potential users is to ask the project owner, as they are probably more familiar with the project's business needs and already have some level of understanding that they can share. Focus out exactly what you need to know in order to plan and produce the content and find tailored ways to get explicit answers. Sometimes answers to questions will be “it depends”, in which case go for the most common answer, or try to refine the question. Paul goes on to cite the example of the UK Government Digital Service.

> “Users wanted to know what the VAT rate was. VAT is a tax applied to some goods and services in the UK. But the rate varies for some products such as children’s car seats and home energy. Then there are some things that are exempt from the tax. In short it is confusing and the answer to the question is, “it depends”. That said, the majority of users want to know the standard VAT rate. That is why the Government Digital Service made sure they led with this. They want to serve the majority of people first, before going on to deal with edge cases. Don't get bogged down in complexity. Follow the example of gov.uk and provide the answer most people care about first.”

> *- Paul Boag*

So let's look into what “content first” might really mean and try to steer towards this “question first” approach.

## Planning

Planning content for web projects must be collaborative. The project owner may find it easy, or at least more interesting, to list their business objectives or talk about timelines and budgets, but likely less so to determine the tone and style and format of their product's content. Similarly the designers and developers on your team might not be enthusiastic about it either; at this stage they probably have a similar understanding to yours as to the project's basic requirements and may already have their own ideas about the way they want to do things. So you'll need to find a way to involve everyone at the start and put “content first” as it were. How about a content planning workshop?

The advantage of holding such a meeting is that it brings together all those who will be involved in producing and handling content. Everyone around the table can undertand better their responsibilities in this process, expectations can be set and surprises avoided. You'll obviously need the client manager, the project manager, any copywriters or translators, and a developer who can advise if there are any technical considerations. Obviously every project will require that people in different roles be present. By having more people present from a variety of different roles you may also get a wider variety of ideas and suggestions. It's crucial that both the project manager and any content producers or maintainers be present. You're aiming in this workshop to get buy-in from the top and and a solid production plan from the bottom.

Plan ahead and determine which topics you want to discuss and which questions to ask. This is essentially going to be a brainstorming session rather than a presentation, so prepare lots of pens and paper, arrange a whiteboard, maybe try and hold the workshop in an inspiring or interesting location away from everyone's daily work environment.




Content Strategy Basics


Creating a Comprehensive Strategy and Governance
The goal of content strategy is to create meaningful, cohesive, engaging, and sustainable content.  Throughout her book, Content Strategy for the Web, Kristina Halvorson discusses in detail the benefits of and how to create your content strategy.  It reiterates that your strategy helps you to identify what already exists, what should be created and, more importantly, why it should be created. 

Melissa Rach has created what she calls the Content Strategy Quad Site exit disclaimer to help describe the content-oriented and people-oriented components you need to know. We have adapted it a bit to discuss the components that come together to help you create a successful strategy and governance.

Content-oriented Components	People-oriented Components
Identify Goals and Substance: focuses on what content is required to successfully execute your core strategy. It includes characteristics such as messaging architecture, intended audience(s), and voice and tone.	Outline the Roles and Workflow: focuses on how people manage and maintain content on a daily basis, including the roles, tasks, and tools required throughout the content lifecycle.
Determine Structure: focuses on how content is prioritized, organized, and accessed. Focuses on the content itself, including mapping messages to content, content bridging, and creating detailed page tables.	Identify Policies and Standards: focuses on the policies, standards, and guidelines that apply to content and its lifecycle, as well as how an organization will sustain and evolve its content strategy.
Content Lifecycle
Producing compelling and sustainable content means that you need to understand and follow the content lifecycle.  Erin Scime identifies that there are five stages in the lifecycle.  In general, content lifecycles include the following:

Audit and Analysis:  Content stakeholder interviews, competitive analysis, objective analysis and evaluation of the content environment (site, partner content, sister, parent sites)
Strategy: Determine topical ownership areas, taxonomy, process/ workflow for content production, sourcing plan, voice and brand definition
Plan: Staffing recommendations, content management system customization, metadata plan, communications plan, migration plan
Create: Writing content, asset production, governance model, search engine optimization, quality assurance
Maintain: Plan for periodic auditing, advise the client, determine targets for success measures.
Several of the deliverables related to each of those phases overlap with the deliverables of other fields, including information architecture, user research, project management, web analytics.  Instead of thinking of who owns each deliverable, it’s important to think of who contributes to each and how those different contributions come together to define the final product.  There’s value in including multiple perspectives on deliverables.

Best Practices for Creating Meaningful Content
We have identified these best practices to help you create meaningful and relevant content.  Each piece of content should:

Reflect your organization’s goals and user’s needs.  You can discover your user’s needs through conducting market research, user research, and analyzing web metrics.
Understand how user’s think and speak about a subject. Content should then be created and structured based on that.  Doing this will also help you with search engine optimization (SEO).
Communicate to people in a way that they understand.  Embracing plain writing principles helps with this.
Be useful.  By being purposeful in the content that you include, omit the needless.
Stay up-to-date and and remain factual.  When new information becomes available, update your content or archive it.
Be accessible to all people.  You have a responsibility to make sure that all people can access and benefit from your information.
Be consistent.  Following style guides, both for language and design, helps people understand and learn what you are trying to communicate.
Be able to be found.  Make sure that users can find your content both through internally through navigation and also externally through search engines.
Help define the requirements for the overall site.  Content should drive design, structure, etc





### Modelling/Strategy

We, the people who make websites, have been talking for fifteen years about user experience, information architecture, content management systems, coding, metadata, visual design, user research, and all the other disciplines that facilitate our users’ abilities to find and consume content.

Weirdly, though, we haven’t been talking about the meat of the matter. We haven’t been talking about the content itself.

Yeah, yeah. We know how to write for online readers. We know bullet lists pwn.

But who among us is asking the scary, important questions about content, such as “What’s the point?” or “Who cares?” Who’s talking about the time-intensive, complicated, messy content development process? Who’s overseeing the care and feeding of content once it’s out there, clogging up the tubes and dragging down our search engines?

As a community, we’re rather quiet on the matter of content. In fact, we appear to have collectively, silently come to the conclusion that content is really somebody else’s problem—“the client can do it,” “the users will generate it”—so we, the people who make websites, shouldn’t have to worry about it in the first place.

Do you think it’s a coincidence, then, that web content is, for the most part, crap?

Dealing with content is messy. It’s complicated, it’s painful, and it’s expensive.

And yet, the web is content. Content is the web. It deserves our time and attention.

And that’s where content strategy comes in.

What is Content Strategy?
Content strategy plans for the creation, publication, and governance of useful, usable content.

Necessarily, the content strategist must work to define not only which content will be published, but why we’re publishing it in the first place.

Otherwise, content strategy isn’t strategy at all: it’s just a glorified production line for content nobody really needs or wants. (See: your company’s CMS.)

Content strategy is also—surprise—a key deliverable for which the content strategist is responsible. Its development is necessarily preceded by a detailed audit and analysis of existing content—a critically important process that’s often glossed over or even skipped by project teams.

At its best, a content strategy defines:

key themes and messages,
recommended topics,
content purpose (i.e., how content will bridge the space between audience needs and business requirements),
content gap analysis,
metadata frameworks and related content attributes,
search engine optimization (SEO), and
implications of strategic recommendations on content creation, publication, and governance.
But wait…there’s more
In her groundbreaking article, Content Strategy: the Philosophy of Data, Rachel Lovinger said:

The main goal of content strategy is to use words and data to create unambiguous content that supports meaningful, interactive experiences. We have to be experts in all aspects of communication in order to do this effectively.

That’s a tall order. I’d like to propose that, in fact, there are far too many “aspects of communication” for a solitary content strategist to truly claim deep expertise in all of them.

Instead, let’s assume that there are a number of content-related disciplines that deserve their own definition, by turn:

Editorial strategy defines the guidelines by which all online content is governed: values, voice, tone, legal and regulatory concerns, user-generated content, and so on. This practice also defines an organization’s online editorial calendar, including content life cycles.
Web writing is the practice of writing useful, usable content specifically intended for online publication. This is a whole lot more than smart copywriting. An effective web writer must understand the basics of user experience design, be able to translate information architecture documentation, write effective metadata, and manage an ever-changing content inventory.
Metadata strategy identifies the type and structure of metadata, also known as “data about data” (or content). Smart, well-structured metadata helps publishers to identify, organize, use, and reuse content in ways that are meaningful to key audiences.
Search engine optimization is the process of editing and organizing the content on a page or across a website (including metadata) to increase its potential relevance to specific search engine keywords.
Content management strategy defines the technologies needed to capture, store, deliver, and preserve an organization’s content. Publishing infrastructures, content life cycles and workflows are key considerations of this strategy.
Content channel distribution strategy defines how and where content will be made available to users. (Side note: please consider e-mail marketing in the context of this practice; it’s a way to distribute content and drive people to find information on your website, not a standalone marketing tactic.)
Now, this breakdown certainly doesn’t imply that a content strategist can’t or shouldn’t be capable of playing these roles and creating the associated deliverables. In fact, in my experience, the content strategist is a rare breed who’s often willing and able to embrace these roles as necessary to deliver useful, usable content.

BUT. And this is a big “but.” If our community fails to recognize, divide, and conquer the multiple roles associated with planning for, creating, publishing, and governing content, we’ll keep underestimating the time, budget, and expertise it takes to do content right. We won’t clearly define and defend the process to our companies and clients. We’ll keep getting stuck with 11th-hour directives, fix-it-later copy drafts—and we’ll keep on publishing crap.

We can do better. Our clients and employers deserve it. Our audiences deserve it. We as users deserve it.

Take up the torch
David Campbell, the founder of Saks Fifth Avenue, said, “Discipline is remembering what you want.”

When it comes to creating and governing content, it’s easy to forget what we want, or even worse, to settle for less.

Content-tious Strategy
by Jeffrey MacIntyre
But until we commit to treating content as a critical asset worthy of strategic planning and meaningful investment, we’ll continue to churn out worthless content in reaction to unmeasured requests. We’ll keep trying to fit words, audio, graphics, and video into page templates that weren’t truly designed with our business’s real-world content requirements in mind. Our customers still won’t find what they’re looking for. And we’ll keep failing to publish useful, usable content that people actually care about.

Stop pretending content is somebody else’s problem. Take up the torch for content strategy. Learn it. Practice it. Promote it. It’s time to make content matter.

The most important thing

The most important thing anyone can do on a web project is find its nucleus. The core, that central piece of content around which everything orbits. Finding that reveals how all of the content fits together. It offers clarity to the relationships between the project’s content and the project’s vision, and will make your process far more successful.

A website is a black hole without content, and finding that core piece saves us from being sucked into the gravitational pull of building fancy buckets to hold lorem ipsum. It changes our center of gravity from a negative to a positive and connects people to people. The web exists to connect us—not to machines, but to each other. Unless the machine is Data, then I’m cool with that.

I help teams find the content nucleus through a collaborative responsive content modeling process that anyone can—and should—do.

Finding this core content will speed up the future design, content and development process. The entire team (vendors, stakeholders, audiences) will walk away with a common understanding and vision. Every time you write or revise, you’ll think about that core piece of content and refocus. The content authoring experience becomes what you it was always meant to be: dreamy.

So. Why model?

We live in a multi-device world and that’s not likely to change. Considering the number of current devices alone is mind boggling. Our content could be displayed on TVs, laptops, iPhones, android devices, Times-Square-type displays, projections, watches, audio devices… and this list grew as I typed.

Don’t you want your core idea—your primary message—to be clear and easy to access on all devices? Of course you do! Finding the nucleus of your content will make that happen. Prioritizing core content will also make it display-ready for gadgets like Google Glass and Apple Watches. Maybe that future device will share content wirelessly from a touch-screen watch to an audio interface in your sunglasses. BOOM—your prioritized content will be in place and ready for duty!

The team also orbits this central content. The process unites far flung members who aren’t sure how they’d work together to make a project successful. When they rally to find this central content, they become bonded by its gravitational pull. It’s the number one exercise I lead that causes that aha moment—the moment people understand how the project will succeed. It isn’t just finding the atomic piece that is the big win—it finding it together.

The right expectations

You *will* find a great solution. Everyone on the team needs to believe in the success of this activity. Positive thinking goes a long way to achieving success. And, honestly, I’ve never lead a session that hasn’t been successful.

The activity will be intense. There will be times when everyone’s staring into space, rocking to self-sooth. Pushing through will bring success. I promise.

The right team

You need people in the room who have the right passion and the right information. Here’s a typical team:

UX lead
Content strategist
Developer
Client project sponsor
Client IT lead
Client content specialist
It may not be possible to have these specialists for every project, but there’s probably people with these general responsibilities in their official (or unofficial) job descriptions. The goal is to involve people who understand the problem, are passionate about solving it, and have the authority to make decisions. A lot will happen during the workshop that will be foundational for future work.

The right foundation

How do you find your core pieces of content and your team’s aha moment? This can’t happen without these few foundational steps.

Step One — Know your content

Inventory everything you have. An audit will give you a clear picture of not only what exists, but its quality and reason for existing (OUCH/ROT).

Step Two — Know your purpose

Knowing your audiences and their priorities
Creating a UX vision for the project
Understanding your design principles
Setting your high-level goals for the site
We have to know what exists to know its purpose and to see patterns. We need to know our purpose because we can’t know what our central content type is without knowing who we’re communicating with and why. If you don’t know who you’re talking to, its pretty damn hard to write for them.

Getting our hands dirty

Having everyone together is key. Sometimes this means being locked in a room for the better part of a week. Sometimes just a couple days. It might look like a jury talking through the most important case ever.

We take breaks as a group and lunch gets delivered. Responsive content modeling is a team-building exercise—with less trust falls and more post-it notes. But trust will be crucial. Everyone needs to feel safe to speak freely, and that’s tricky without trust.

First the who, the why, and the what

So we don’t fall into the trap of letting opinion guide our decisions, it’s important that we establish our who: our audience and their needs.

The UX vision is the big WHY statement we’re striving for. Fire off a quick draft to get it out there and ensure it is pointing the group towards the right target down.

For the City of Red Deer our first draft stuck.

A web first organization that empowers anyone to access City of Red Deer information and services in any way they choose.

The next step is to establish the project’s design principles. These are the guideposts for all decision making during the project. They’re the values or why statements that will keep us moving towards the vision. Think of them as the guiding principles.

From the same project for the City of Red Deer we came up with seven design principles.

Users first
Help users get the information they want by focusing on common user expectations.

Sustainable
Plan for content, technical, and information architecture that can be easily maintained for the long term.

Accessibility
Create content that is accessible for the majority of people (using web accessibility guidelines) and the majority of devices (using responsive web design).

For real people
Engage people through a clear and honest voice.

Relevant content
Represent connections within the community through content related to City business and services.

Passion for your content
Everyone – the public, content authors, content champions – own, care for, and love their content.

Progressive enhancement
Start with the core experience available for all, and enhance the user experience when possible. (Ex: additional columns for wide screen, GPS location on certain devices). Protect the core.

With this framework established, we can dig in to the content modeling phase of our workshop. We’re going to prioritize every content type and as a team. We must agree on everything—no compromise. This is a must.

This is where we focus on audience needs and toss opinions aside. This is the secret to delight audiences and give them what they need.

Content Templates

Here we look at all the content views we’ll need, like the home page, landing page, standard content page, news releases, application templates, advanced search, etc. Often there is an established list based on an earlier contract, and this will ensure sure we have everything we need based on audits, audiences, and previous conversations.

We compare content templates with the vision and goals—taking everything we know about the content/audience/message and begin to prioritize them.

Where will the content live?
Where will the most important content to the primary audiences be found?
Will it live on the homepage or a landing page?
Is this a page where search is dominant?
Now we prioritize the content templates. Number one being the most important. The higher the number, the less important a content type is. Everything must have a priority and everyone in the group must agree (again, no compromise).

It will be important to know how to argue well and speak your mind.

A good resource is Dan Brown’s listening list from his great book *Designing Together*. I introduce it at the start of every workshop.

[edit]Dan shared a nice printer-friendly version of the checklist. Thanks Dan!

You need a strong facilitator for this piece. This can be anyone who understand a project’s process and purpose. The best facilitators are often the experience architect or the content strategist. Remember, there is no such thing as the client team and the vendor team: there is only the project team. You can’t successfully find that thing that bonds the team and the content by working separately.

For a government project I worked on, as we decided on primary audiences, content, and where the content would live, we discovered that the number one content template was the standard content page. Site visitors were looking for information like how to pay taxes or how to register for a dog license. This kind of information would live on a standard content page. Landing pages, listing page, and search were an important part of their journey, but not the information they were looking for.

Looking for the nucleus (content types)

Yay us! We found and prioritized the core content templates. Now we really need to get more granular and find the unique content type that everything orbits—the content nucleus or the atomic content type (Science! #FTW!).

We need list the discrete content types of our content templates: page title, contact module, featured image, teaser copy, main body copy, related items, location, etc. Each content type needs to be written out, probably on a whiteboard, until we’re sure everything is on the list. This may include items that we’re not sure we want included—that’s okay in a greenlight stage like this. We’ll deal with these later.

Step One!

Attach a high level priority of one, two, or three to each content type or item on the list.

One = essential. This view wouldn’t be able to function or communicate the core message without this item.
Two = great to have. These items fully support the core purpose of this view.
Three = nice to have. If these items didn’t exist it wouldn’t have a huge impact on the view.
If you start to label items with a four, they’re probably pointless. Make note, but remove them. Everything should point people towards the core purpose of this content.

Some priority three elements might reveal themselves as necessary and some priority ones could get demoted.Things will shift as the team progresses, but remember that everyone in the group must agree.

Content Model and Sketches on whiteboard

Step Two!

We’re not done yet. Now we go back through the three priority groups and assign a priority order to each element within each group. Be prepared to duke it out, laugh, cry, and sweat through this hard, but essential work. It’s not about compromise, it is about focusing on what’s best for the prioritized audiences.

This is why we established a framework through our UX Vision, design principles, and high level goals. We return to those guideposts for every decision, because opinions won’t move us forward. Considering the needs of our audiences will.

Something must be the very first priority and something must be the last. Try this mantra. EVERYTHING MUST BE PRIORITIZED OR ALL WILL DIE. Okay, don’t do that. But do take it seriously and resist the urge to quit—I promise it will be worth it. This is essentially a less technical, but more human-centered method of content modeling.

Sara Wachter-Boettcher captures this wonderfully in her book, *Content Everywhere*.

Content modeling requires you to simultaneously understand your goals at the highest level and get intimate with your content’s most minute attributes, and there’s a pretty big chasm in between. Luckily, there’s an entire discipline dedicated to bridging that divide: content strategy.

This step is when we begin to understand what we’re working to accomplish. The team continues to set priorities until every content type on this template has a unique priority.

Once these priorities are set, content type 1–1 is the most important. This is your core content type. Sometimes it can be 1 and 2 together, which was the case in the government site I mentioned earlier. It was the page title and the clarity copy on the content page that described to the audience what to expect from the content. Everything else connected to that content type.

These thousands of pages, inventories and audits flow out from this unique content type. This is how new design systems, content systems, and web communications tools become successful, gain purpose, and allow people to consistently find the information they’re looking for.

In a multi-device world where content can live anywhere, this is one of the most important things you can do to make your content successful.  Content should adapt to all platforms and be represented consistently. We can do this by making sure that priority 1–1 content is the first users see on any device.

Regardless of content being accessed on a pebble watch or a billboard with constraints, the fundamental message is as clear as it would be on a desktop. And for the 90% of people who start a task on one device and complete it on another, they’re seeing the congruence of this atomic piece of content and the connections it brings.

Basically, you just became a jr. content strategists. Achievement unlocked!

Sketching

Now it’s time to sketch! We start to draw out the content and interaction patterns while thinking about priority, audience needs, vision, and principles. Keep in mind that priority doesn’t necessarily mean something comes first in a linear fashion. It could mean it has a higher placement in the visual hierarchy.

To make this work for responsive web design (RWD) projects, it’s important to do at least two sketches for each unique content template. One small screen and one large screen. As it isn’t practical to sketch the thousands of possible moments between break points on a RWD, these two sketches won’t cover everything, but they’’ll give your future in-browser wireframes a head start and force you to think in both contexts.

The goal is to keep priorities across all breakpoints that you sketch while representing them with the right interaction and content patterns for each screen size. Congruency in experience and content.

Get it on the web

Get the documented content types into in-browser wireframes to help demonstrate the content priorities and interaction patterns. This will allow us to test it on multiple devices and make sure our priorities hold up—do they align with the vision and principles?


This also allows the design to be informed by the content. As the design continues to progress into visual design, we make decisions based on the content—we can’t do our design work properly without understanding our content. A website is a black hole without content and so is a design system.

Document everything

As you move through each phase, take pictures of the whiteboards, keep notes, and save post-it notes. This will help you move into the next steps and help you communicate the value of what you just accomplished.

Fixing the Web

You too can find the core piece of content and move your project forward while focusing on the the important bits.

The content modeling notes will become annotations on future wireframes, your sketches will be the blueprints for the wireframes. Content authors will understand how it all fits together and project stakeholders will see rapid progress with high value.

People love this process. I’ve had an IT manager stifle a giggle while he announced to the team, “I love this process so much.”

Finding the core piece of content really is the key to every web project, big or small. It will make your projects more successful and build a better, more thoughtful web, one content type at a time.

http://24ways.org/2014/content-production-planning/

While everyone agrees that getting the content of a website right is vital to its success, unless you’re lucky enough to have an experienced editor or content strategist on board, planning content production often seems to fall through the cracks. One reason is that, for most of the team, it feels like someone else’s problem. Not necessarily a specific person’s problem. Just someone else’s. It’s only when everyone starts urgently asking when the content is going to be ready, that it becomes clear the answer is, “Not as soon as we’d like it”.

The good news is that there are some quick and simple things you can do, even if you’re not the official content person on a project, to get everyone on the same content planning page.

Content production planning boils down to answering three deceptively simple questions:

What content do you need?
How much of it do you need?
Who’s going to make it?
Even if it’s not your job to come up with the answers, by asking these questions early enough and agreeing who is going to come up with the answers, you’ll be a long way towards avoiding the last-minute content problems which so often plague projects.

HOW MUCH CONTENT DO WE NEED?
People tend to underestimate two crucial things about content: how much content they need, and how long that content takes to produce.

When I ask someone how big their website is – how many pages it contains – I usually double or triple the answer I get. That’s because almost everyone’s mental model of their website greatly underestimates its true size. You can see the problem for yourself if you look at a site map. Site maps are great at representing a mental model of a website. But because they’re a deliberate simplification they naturally lead us to underestimate how much content is involved in populating them.

Several years ago I was asked to help a client create a new microsite (their word) which they wanted ready in two weeks for a conference they were attending. Here’s the site map they had in mind. At first glance it looks like a pretty small website. Maybe twenty to thirty pages?

A site map of a small website

That’s what the client thought.

But see those boxes which are multiple boxes stacked on top of one another, for product categories, descriptions and supporting material? They’re known as page stacks, and page stacks are the content strategy equivalent of Here Be Dragons.

A site map's page stack labelled 'here be dragons'

Say we have:

five product categories
each with five products
which all have two or three supporting documents
Those are still fairly small numbers. But small numbers multiplied by other small numbers tend to lead to big numbers.

5 categories = 5 category descriptions

plus

5 categories × 5 products each = 25 product descriptions

plus

25 products × 2.5 (average) supporting documents = 63 supporting documents

equals

93 pages

Suddenly our twenty- or thirty-page website is running towards one hundred.

That’s probably enough to get most project teams to sit up and take notice. But there’s still the danger of underestimating how long it’s going to take to create the content. After all, assuming the supporting documents already exist in some form, there are only about twenty-five to thirty pages of new copy to write.

HOW MUCH WORK IS IT?
Again, we have the problem that small numbers when multiplied by other small numbers tend to lead to big numbers. Let’s make a rough guess that it’ll take four hours to write each product category and description page we need. That feels a little conservative if we’re writing stuff from scratch, but assuming the person doing it already knows the products fairly well it’s not unreasonable.

30 pages × 4 hours each = 120 hours

120 hours ÷ 7.5 working hours a day = 16 days

Ouch.

At this point it’s pretty clear we’re not getting this site launched in two weeks.

THE GOAL IS THE CONVERSATION
By breaking down the site into its content components, and putting some rough estimates on how long each might take to produce, the client instantly realised that there was no way they would be ready to launch it in two weeks. Although we still didn’t know exactly when it would be ready, getting to that realisation right at the start of the project was a major win for everybody. Without it, the design agency would have bust a gut to get the design, front-end and CMS all done in double-quick time, only to find it was all for nothing as barely half the content was ready. As it was, an early discussion about content, albeit a brief one, bought everyone time to tackle the project properly, without pulling any long nights or working weekends.

If you haven’t been able to get people to discuss content plans for the project, these kinds of rough estimates should give you enough evidence to get everyone to start taking it seriously. Your goal is to get everyone on the project to a place where they are ready to talk in detail about who is going to create this content, and how long it’s really going to take them, and to get to those conversations before lack of content becomes a problem.

Be careful though. It’s best to talk in ranges and round numbers when your estimates are this uncertain. And watch those multipliers. Given small numbers multiplied by other small numbers lead to big numbers, changing just one number can greatly change the overall estimate. I like to run a couple of different scenarios to check what things look like if I’ve under- or overestimated either how many pages we’re going to need, or how long they’re going to take to create. For example:

Top end: 30 pages × 5 hours = 150 hours, or 20 days

Bottom end: 25 pages × 4 hours = 100 hours, or 13.3 days

So rather than say, “I estimate the content will take around sixteen days to produce”, I’m going to say, “I think the content will take about three to four weeks to produce”. Even with qualifiers like estimate and around, sixteen days sounds too precise. Whereas three to four weeks instantly conveys that this is just a rough figure.

WHO’S GOING TO MAKE IT?
So, people tend to underestimate two crucial things about content: how much content they need, and how long content takes to write. At this stage, you’re still in danger of the latter, because it’s tempting to simply estimate how much time content takes to write (or record, if we’re talking audio or visual content), and overlook all the other work that needs to goes on around it.

Take 24 ways as an example. In terms of our three deceptively simple questions: what is practical articles about web design; how many is twenty-four, one for each day of Advent; and who are experts working on the web, one to write each article.

But there’s another who you might not have considered.

Someone needs to select those authors in the first place, make sure they deliver their articles on time (and find someone to replace them if they don’t), review drafts, copy-edit and proofread final versions, upload them to the site, promote them, keep an eye on the comments and make sure there are still presents under the tree on Christmas morning.

Even if each of those tasks only takes an hour or so, it then needs multiplying by twenty-four (except the presents, obviously). And as we’ve already seen, small numbers multiplied by small numbers quickly turn into much bigger numbers. Just a few hours per article, when multiplied by twenty-four articles, easily multiplies up to days or even weeks of effort.

To get a more accurate estimate of how long the different kinds of content are going to take, you need to break down the content production work into its constituent stages, starting with planning, moving on through the main work of creation, to reviewing, approvals and finally publishing. You need to think about who needs to be involved at each step, and how much time they’ll need to do their bit.

Taken together, these things make up your content workflow. The workflow will be different for each organisation, but might look something like this:

Eddie the web editor will work out the key messages and objectives for each page, and agree them with Mo the marketing director.
Eddie will then get Cal, the copywriter, to write the first draft.
As part of that, Cal will interview Sam the subject expert to understand the intricacies of the subject and get all the facts straight.
Once Cal’s done the first draft, it’ll go to Sam to check for accuracy, while Eddie reviews it for style and message.
Once Cal has incorporated their feedback it’s time to get Mo to have a look at the final draft.
If Mo’s happy, it’ll get a final proofread, be uploaded to the CMS, and Mo will give the final sign-off and release it for publishing.
You can plot this on a table, with the stages of the content production process down the side, and the key roles or personnel along with top. Then the team can estimate how much time they think each of them needs at each stage.

Mo (marketing director)	Sam (subject expert)	Eddie (web editor)	Cal (copywriter)
Outline: define key messages and objectives			30 min	
Review outline	15 min			
First draft		30 min		3 hours
Review 1st draft		30 min	30 min	
2nd draft				1 hour
Review 2nd draft	15 min	15 min	15 min	
Final amendments				30 min
Proofread			15 min	
Upload				15 min
Sign-off	10 min			
TOTAL	40 min	1 hour 15 min	1 hour 30 min	4 hours 45 min
You can then bring out your calculator again, and come up with some more big scary numbers showing how much time it’s going to take for the whole team to get all the content needed not just written, but also planned, reviewed, approved and published.

With an experienced team you can run this exercise as a group workshop and get some fairly accurate estimates pretty quickly. If this is all a bit new to you, check out Gather Content’s Content Production Planning for Agencies ebook for a useful guide to common content roles, ballpark estimates for how much time each one needs on a typical piece of content, and how to run a process and estimating workshop to dig into them in more detail.

On a small team, one person might play many roles, but you should still sanity-check your estimates by breaking down the process and putting a rough estimate on each stage. With only a couple of people involved, it’s even easier to only include the core activity like writing or recording in your estimates, and forget to allow time for the planning, reviewing, proofreading, publishing and promoting you’ll still need to do. And even in a team of one, if at all possible you should find at least one other person to act as a second pair of eyes, and give anything you produce a quick once-over and proofread before it’s published.

Depending on the kind of content you’re making, you should also consider what will happen after it’s published. The full content life cycle should include promotion, monitoring and regular reviews to make sure content stays accurate and up to date. Making sure you have the time and resources available to do all those things for each piece of content is essential for creating a sustainable content programme.

THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING
Even after digging into workflow and getting the whole team involved in estimating, you’re still largely in the realm of the guesstimate. The good news, though, is that you can quite quickly start finding out if your guesstimates are right or not. As soon as you can, pilot the production process with some real content. This is a double-win: you start finding out how long it really takes to produce all this fab new content, and you get real content to work with in designs and prototypes.

Once you’ve run a few things through your process, you’ll be able to refine your estimates, confirm your workflow, and give everyone involved a clear idea of when it will all be ready, and what you need from them.

KEEPING IT ALL ON TRACK
At this point I like to pull everything together into the content strategist’s favourite tool: the spreadsheet.

A simple content production checklist is a bit like a content inventory or audit, but for the content you don’t yet have, not the stuff already done. You can grab an example here.

Each piece of content gets its own row, with columns for basic information like page title, ID (which should match the site map), and who’s responsible for making it. You can capture simple details like target audience and key messages here too, though for more complex content, page description tables like those described by Relly Annett-Baker in “Extracting the Content” may be a better tool to use. Just adapt these columns to whatever makes sense for your content.

I then have columns to track where each piece is in the production process. I usually keep this simple, with a column each to mark whether it’s draft, final or uploaded. The status column on the left automatically shows the item’s status, using a simple traffic light colour scheme for whether the item is still to do (red), in draft (amber), or done (green). Seeing the whole thing slowly turn from red to green is a nice motivator.

If you want to track the workflow in more detail, a kanban board in a tool like Trello is a great way for a team to collaborate on content production, track each item’s progress, and keep an eye out for bottlenecks and delays.

GETTING TO THE CONTENT STRATEGY CONVERSATION
It’s a relatively simple exercise, then, to decide not just what kinds of pages you need, but also how many of them: put some rough estimates of effort on the tasks needed to create those pages – not just the writing, but all the other stages of planning, reviewing, approving, publishing and promoting – and then multiply all those things together. This will quickly bring some reality to grand visions and overambitious plans. Do it early enough, and even when the final big scary number is a lot bigger and scarier than everyone thought, you’ll still have time to do something about it.

As well as getting everyone on board for some proper content planning activities, that big scary number is your opportunity to get to the real core questions of content strategy: do we really need all this content? Where can existing content be reused and repurposed? How do we prioritise our efforts? What really matters to our readers and users?

Time and again, case studies show that less content delivers more: more leads, more sales, more self-service support and savings in the call centre. Although that argument is primarily one you should make from a good-for-the-users perspective, it doesn’t hurt to be able to make it from the cheaper-for-the-business perspective as well, and to have some big scary numbers to back that up.

### Map Your Process
First, look at the production stages that a piece of content will need to go through before it is ready to be published. This generally starts with identifying the key content types (for example, “product pages,” “course summary pages,” “how-to guides”). Content types are not necessarily “pages” as such, but could be more modular components of the website — things like product specifications or staff biographies.
Look at the production stages that a piece of content will need to go through before it is ready to be published.
Look at the production stages that a piece of content will need to go through before it is ready to be published.
Once you’ve identified the main content types, look at what’s involved in taking them from a basic page brief (which outlines what an item of content is supposed to achieve) to a product that is published and maintained.
CHOOSE A CONTENT TYPE
Choose a content type that you expect to appear on your new website, such as a service or product page, a blog post or a course outline. Choose something that everyone can relate to; avoid specialized content types such as legal documents and engineering reports.
MAP A PUBLISHING PROCESS
In groups, map out a production process to get a single piece of content published on the new website. Again, this will vary a lot according to your team (for example, depending on who will be doing the heavy lifting of producing the content).
A simple workflow might look something like this:
Draft content
Edit tone of voice
Review internally
Get approval from client
Optimize for search engines
Import to CMS
Review web page
Publish
Maintain
The workflow will vary considerably from project to project. You might need to account for legal and compliance reviews or technical accuracy, or you might need to specify phases for formatting and publishing content (such as formatting for mobile or converting items into downloadable PDF documents). This is another reason to start with a fairly generic piece of content, and then move on to creating more elaborate workflows for specific content types or sections of the website.
The bias that stems from people’s roles in the project is always interesting to see (which is why having people with different roles involved in the workshop is so valuable in the first place). You might find legal representatives claiming to need four separate stages for legally reviewing every page, while a copywriter might want to break the editing for tone of voice into multiple phases. A concerted team effort should result in a workflow that is balanced, realistic and agreed on.

### Assign Responsibility
One of the most powerful things about these workshops is that you assign responsibility, making clear who exactly is accountable for which work. Failing to clarify responsibility over content is one of the most common causes for delays. Bottlenecks happen usually because people simply do not know they were expected to produce content or because responsibility has all been put on one person. This part of the workshop should prevent such trouble.
Failing to clarify responsibility over content is one of the most common causes for delays.
Failing to clarify responsibility over content is one of the most common causes for delays.
ASSIGN RESPONSIBILITY
Annotate each stage on your sheet with the person or role responsible for it. This might look something like this:
Draft content: subject expert
Edit tone of voice: copywriter
Review internally: senior editor
Get approval from client: project owner
Optimize for search engines: SEO editor
Import to CMS: CMS editor
Review web page: project owner
Publish: CMS editor
Maintain: subject expert
IDENTIFY LACK OF OWNERSHIP
Mark any stages that don’t have a clear owner. This is often a huge revelation. “We need to hire an SEO editor!” “We need a copywriter!” “We need a pastry chef!” By simply highlighting the parts of the process for which no one is responsible, you’ll quickly see where the challenges for your project lie. By acknowledging these now, you will save a huge amount of stress down the line. You might find that the plan is solid and has no gaps, or you might immediately see that hiring a copywriter will save you a whole lot of trouble. Either way, this part of the workshop is critical.
CLARIFY RESPONSIBILITIES
Ask, “Do the people responsible know they are responsible?” This is another great opportunity to minimize risk. Make sure that everyone knows what’s expected of them, and see whether anyone has too much on their plate. A well-organized content inventory or dedicated project-management software comes in handy here.

### Identify Risks In The Process
Building on the previous step, make sure the following questions are resolved to avoid bottlenecks.
“DO TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE A SAY?”
Multiple heads are sometimes not better than one for producing content. Keep an eye out for pages or sections of the website that have a lot of editors and reviewers involved. I’ve seen so many projects delayed because content was bounced between editors for days on end, often just leading to over-edited and nonsensical text.
“IS ONE PERSON OVERBURDENED?”
These workshops are the perfect time to assess the volume of work assigned to individuals and assess how realistically they can get it done. Give less outspoken people a chance to air their concerns, which is a lot easier when you’ve estimated the hours of work involved. Speak with each individual to review their workload.
“DO WE HAVE THE SKILLS REQUIRED?”
Is poorly written content a risk? Or could the content be misinformed (due to a lack of expertise)? Will the content be optimized for search engines? Go back to your content requirements and make sure you have the manpower to meet them all. If you don’t, call for some outside help.
“WHERE MIGHT THINGS GET POLITICAL OR CONTENTIOUS?”
It’s an awkward subject to broach, but organizational politics could pose a serious threat to the project. I’ve often seen people hold back their opinion (or, more dangerously, overestimate their ability to deliver work) due to certain people being in the room or politics. The best way to deal with this is simply to treat all team members as equals and to ask probing questions of everyone in the room.

### Estimate Hours
It might not be easy, but try to calculate the man hours of work required to complete each stage of the process. This isn’t the same as calculating how long it will take to complete a stage, although both are important when planning resourcing.
Estimatehow much effort is required to complete each stage.
Estimatehow much effort is required to complete each stage.
ESTIMATE WORKLOAD
Estimate (in fractions of hours) how much effort is realistically required to complete each stage. Once you’ve come to an agreement on the time required, write the number beside each stage. If the debate about estimates is taking too long, you could try adapting the “planning poker” technique used in scrum.
CALCULATE TIME
Add up the time required to complete all stages. This might be a good time for a break.
ESTIMATE TOTAL WORKLOAD
Multiply the total time by the number of pages anticipated for the website to get an estimate of the total amount of effort required for all of your content. As mentioned, you might be dealing with modules or items of content (things like product specifications or staff biographies), rather than pages. Either way, consider the average size of these items to get a realistic estimate of the time required to get the work done. I often group together additional content, such as microcopy, treating it as a single item in the calculation.
The calculation might look like this: 4 hours (time to produce and approve one page) × 125 pages = 500 hours of work.

### Present The Process
Everyone should review the process at the end of the workshop to be clear on what’s going to happen, who is doing what and how it will be implemented. This is also a good time to outline the next steps.
WALK THROUGH THE PROCESS
Each group should walk the whole team through their process (on a sheet of paper) and then open up the presentation for discussion. The person facilitating the workshop should go around and get input from everyone in the room. Address any concerns or anxieties immediately. Concerns tend to focus on whether there is enough time! Also, address any technical issues that people might not feel confident asking about.
Try to film the presentations so that any absent stakeholders can keep up with the discussion.
Following this discussion, move on to the slightly more serious task of setting realistic deadlines for the content and assigning responsibility. Talk about the software you might use to host your editorial calendar, once you have a clear idea of the process that the software has to support. Choosing the software first could lead you to have to shoehorn the process in; this is best avoided!
Workshops Work
That’s the process we’ve developed to run workshops with our clients. Hopefully, this template will help you to run successful content-planning workshops of your own and, more importantly, help you to get content finished on time and to a high standard.
With everyone on the same page (literally), the risk of delays with content production will be far less.



## Design & Responsiveness

How to be web content agnostic (and why you should)
webdesignerdepot.com
You cannot design without content. It’s a mantra repeated by designers worldwide, it’s a plea in countless emails to clients, it’s a cornerstone of responsible design.

One of the most respected names on the Web, Jeffrey Zeldman, summarises it neatly in a pinned tweet:

Content precedes design. Design in the absence of content is not design, it’s decoration.
— Jeffrey Zeldman (@zeldman) May 5, 2008
This is because design is about solving problems. If content were a pill, design would be the sugar coating.

However designing with content is contrary to the direction the Web is moving in, and may even be damaging for your clients…

 

The myth of designing content

The truth is, you aren’t designing with actual content.

Let’s leave aside the idea that clients don’t deliver content on time — plenty do, and those that don’t simply need you to project manage — for the sake of discussion, let’s assume you begin the design process with a nice shiny email from your client with comprehensive content attached.

You’re still not designing the actual content, because the nature of content on the Web is that it’s transient.

changes in content should not necessitate a redesign

When was the last time you worked on a website that didn’t run on a CMS? Did you think the company just wanted to keep their phone numbers up to date? Companies don’t change their phone numbers. What they do is let the VP of marketing run riot with the WordPress login the first weekend your back is turned.

Content on the Web is always temporary. Natural changes in content should not necessitate a redesign.

We’ve sold ourselves the myth of designing content because it syncs nicely with our view of good design being invisible. However, with this approach what we’re really designing is a single iteration of content, the lifecycle of which is undetermined. Designing content is damaging for clients if we allow ourselves to be seduced by the idea that we’re working with fixed content.

Think of being content agnostic as responsive design, from the other direction: whilst still respecting content, we accept that it’s substantially unknowable and so our designs must adapt to whatever content is inserted.

 

Designing dummy content

Unless you’re typesetting an academic essay written entirely in latin, then lorem ipsum will not be representative of your content, and most web designers rightly avoid it. However, it’s wrong to say that dummy content serves no purpose. Dummy content can be valuable if it’s prototypical of site content. Ideally it will have three characteristics:

it will be the same language as your content;
it will be the approximate length and rhythm as your content;
it will be on a similar subject to your content.
These three characteristics will ensure you encounter the same problems in your design process, as your actual content will when live.

Take for example a staff biography. Provided you know that it’s written in English, is the résumé of a senior manager with an engineering background, and will be a single paragraph of no more than 100 words, then you can design that element. Staff bios are frequently updated, and staff turnover is often high. Any solution you provide needs to be robust enough to adapt to these kinds of changes, or it’s not fit for purpose.

Our work isn’t theoretical, but that doesn’t mean we need actual content to design. What we need are content models: accurate prototypes that allow us to explore design issues, without the restrictions of ‘final’ copy.

 

Design precedes content

When we expect content to change, we have to design not content, but placeholders for content.

Take a look at a newspaper. It is a practical impossibility that the entire content be designed each night. Thousands of lines and hundreds of columns are slotted into a pre-designed structure. When the structure doesn’t fit the content, it’s the copy that is padded or truncated; not the design. Pt size on inserts can be tweaked, images can be scaled, but in general terms the design of a newspaper dictates its content.

Happily we don’t face the same issue on the Web; we have scrolling. However, similar problems online are resolved with similar solutions.

The Guardian newspaper has just launched an excellent responsive redesign of its website. When designing headlines, they’ve worked to ensure that a five word headline sits comfortably alongside a fourteen word headline. The approach is successful because the team at The Guardian have designed the site, not for content, but for a range of potential content. There are restrictions — you couldn’t insert a fifty word headline — but the solution is flexible enough to handle content growth.

theguardian
Because content is liable to change, design will inevitably precede content. The solution to this problem is to adopt a content agnostic approach using techniques such as Samantha Warren’s Style Tiles to design for models of content that are robust enough to survive in the wild.

 

Design is content

We know from eye-tracking research that the only time your content is read is when it’s parsed by Googlebot. Most human beings never read websites, they barely look at websites. You and I might, but we’re the exception. Most humans scan a page quickly, click something that looks interesting and repeat the process until they land on an approximation of what they were looking for.

And so, the client’s core message isn’t conveyed by content, it’s conveyed by brand. The colors, type, imagery and a few snatches of content here and there, are what most users base decisions on.

This is the main reason micro-copy is proving to be such a vital part of web design: you won’t make a sale with the opening paragraph of your ‘About Us’ page, but you might with the privacy statement above your contact form.

what we’re really designing…is the framework within which to create content, not the content itself

With the rise of SaaS, designers are increasingly finding that their design work, visual, UX, and strategic, is taking on the role of content. As the Web continues to move away from passive content delivery, to active content creation, design becomes increasingly important as the primary means of communicating.

A product designer doesn’t need to know what words a pen will write in order to design it. He needs to know the general use — whether it will be a brush pen, fountain pen, or rollerball — but the words that it will write are irrelevant to the design process.

The Web is increasingly becoming a place of content creation. We can provide parameters — a maximum 140 characters being the obvious example — but what we’re really designing, whether we do it for clients or their customers, is the framework within which to create content, not the content itself.

 

Conclusion

The myth that we’re designing content is rooted in print design, when content was final as soon as it was dispatched to the printers. Designing content for the Web requires that we embrace the inherent transient nature of our content, or risk limiting the content’s potential by imposing a rigid design on it.

As the definition of what consitutes a website continues to evolve, design will continue to function as content, and content will continue to perform as a design solution. What we design is not a site’s content — which is transient — but rather its aims, its values, its aspirations; what we design is (for want of a better word) its soul.

Far from being decoration, a content agnostic approach forces us to produce a robust design solution that doesn’t impose itself on future content.

Design precedes content. Content in the absence of design is not content, it’s a brief.

Prioritizing Structure in Web Content Projects

Most web content projects have both structural and editorial aspects: for example, the information needs to be structured to support the new responsive design, and the current copy needs an update so it adheres to messaging and brand guidelines.

I’m often asked which is the best order to approach the work: structure first and then rewrites, or the reverse? I didn’t used to have a strong opinion, because it seemed to me like a chicken-and-egg problem. If the project starts with structure, I’m building content models off of bad information. If, instead, we start with rewrites, the writers don’t know what pieces we need to fill the models, because the models don’t exist yet. It felt like both directions were equally fraught, and I didn’t have any strong reasons to recommend one over the other.

(Note that I’m not talking about starting without the editorial foundations of a project: understanding the business goals, establishing a message architecture, and knowing what the work is supposed to accomplish are core pieces of any project. I’m talking instead about rewriting poor content—editing and creating new copy based on those foundations.)

I recently finished up the second phase of a project that we organized to focus on structure first, and reasons to stick with this approach piled up in my lap like turkeys going to roost. I think that a structure-first approach does make sense for the majority of my projects, and here’s why.

Content models are based on what content is for, not what it says#section2

On this particular project, the existing copy was horrible. Jargony, clichéd, and almost stubbornly unhelpful. How could I build a useful content model off of bad content?

As I was working, I realized that the quality of the copy—even if it’s terrible—doesn’t really affect the models. I don’t build models off of the exact words in the content, but instead I build off of what purpose that copy serves. I don’t actually care if the restaurant description reads like teen poetry (sorry teens, sorry poets): it’s the restaurant description, and we need a short, teaser version and a long, full version. The banquet facilities should include well-lit photos taken within the last decade, and the captions should use the appropriate brand voice to describe how the rooms can be used. I don’t actually need to see decent photos or strong captions to build space for them into the models.

Structure decisions influence development and design direction#section3

A complex content model will help inform all kinds of site decisions, from CMS choice to data formatting. Developers can make better architecture decisions when they have a sense of what kinds of relationships exist between content types, and designers can organize a pattern library that matches the granularity of the content model. The earlier the structure work is done, the easier it is to build integrated design and development plans.

Cramming bad content into strong models is an incredibly compelling argument for editorial intervention#section4

When projects are focused on the structural aspects of the work—we want to recombine content for different channels, or make a clever responsive experience using structured fields—people often start out convinced that the current content is decent enough to do the job. “Sure, it could probably use some spiffing up, but that’s just not in the cards right now.”

I have never seen a more effective argument for the importance of editorial work than taking existing copy and seeing how inadequately it fills a model that we’ve already agreed meets our business goals.

A model I built recently had a content type for holding gushy snippets about the business’s amazing customer service. When we went to move the existing content into the new models, the only copy we could find to migrate amounted to “free ice water” and “polite employees.” We had already agreed that telling the story of the brand experience was a key job of the new website, and seeing how thoroughly their current content failed to do that was the kick in the pants they needed to find budget for an editorial assist.

Content models are easy to iterate#section5

Waterfall isn’t a great match for content development any more than it is for design and code, so editorial rewrites often trigger adjustments to the content models. I may split one large field into two smaller ones, or the writers will find a place where I left out an important piece of content altogether. Refining the models is an expected part of the process.

On projects where editorial rewriting has been done first, though, I often end up with copy that, although now written beautifully, has no place in the model. In the course of structuring the information, we combined two pages into one, or are reusing the same description in three places, and so the editorial effort that went into fixing that copy is thrown out before it ever sees the light of day. That’s discouraging, and can lead to content creators feeling like I don’t value their time or their work.

What works for you?#section6

It’s nice to have some strong reasoning behind my structure-first leaning, but of course my experiences may not translate to your project needs at all.

If you’ve worked on a project that organized structure work first, what advantages or drawbacks did that process uncover? From a design and development perspective, are there pros or cons to either direction that aren’t covered here?

If you’re a writer, does creating copy within a content model free or stifle your best work? If you prefer to start with editorial rewrites, what are the hidden benefits for the structural side of the project?

I believe there are real benefits to taking a structure-first approach to organizing content activities, and I’d love to hear how and if that works for your projects as well.

Web Writing Guidelines for Content Contributors

By Rick Allen on April 18, 2011
Web writing
Enable content contributors to write for your website.
As web professionals, we owe a lot to our content contributors. Your college website has tons of content, and no one person can do it all. The more you enable content contributors to write for your site (supported, of course, by a thorough editorial process), the closer you will be to your shared goal of creating great content. Here are some web writing guidelines to help make that happen.
1. Keep your audience in mind.

Consider who will be reading and using your web content. Prospective students, current students, alumni, faculty, staff? What are they looking for, and what do they need? Be sure the tone, language and organization of content is appropriate for your audience.
2. Be concise.

Web writing should be clear and direct. Keep sentences short. Remove words or descriptions that don’t add value to the content. As content strategist Margot Bloomstein says, "Thoreau instructed ‘simplify, simplify.’ You can do him one better. Here’s to snappy writing that gets to the point and knows when to stop!"
3. Make content scannable.

Readers scan web pages before they read. If they don’t recognize useful, relevant content, they often move on. Elements that enhance scanning include headers, links, highlighted text, bulleted lists, graphics, captions and pull-quotes. However, be careful not to overemphasize content and confuse the visual and editorial hierarchy of information. There’s a reason the blink tag is deprecated by the W3C.
4. Write meaningful headers.

Readers rely on headers to navigate on-page content. Choose words for headers and subheaders that clearly describe the content they introduce. Boring, useful words are better than clever, obtuse words.
5. Limit paragraphs to 70 words.

I’ve seen numerous recommended word counts, but I’ve found a 70-word limit to be a practical and effective number in most cases. Of course, less is better.
6. Use bulleted lists whenever possible.

Bulleted lists are easier to scan and read than full paragraphs. If you are listing three or more items, consider using a bulleted list. For instructions or long lists like this one, consider using numbered lists for easy reference.
7. Use active voice.

Writing in the active voice is more clear, conversational and engaging than the passive voice. Just ask Strunk and White: "The active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the passive." Also, "when a sentence is made stronger, it usually becomes shorter. Thus, brevity is a by-product of vigor" (The Elements of Style, Third Edition, pages 18-19).
8. Use common language.

It’s essential for findability and SEO (search engine optimization) to use the same words and phrases your readers do. When creating page titles, headers, list items and links, choose keywords carefully. Additionally, be sure to use keywords consistently when creating web content. When used appropriately, this practice reinforces keyword relevancy for search engines, such as Google and your own internal search, thereby improving findability.
9. Be professional and human.

Think like a publisher and less like a marketer. Use a more conversational tone. Avoid jargon and buzzwords like "cutting-edge" or "leverage." Users are turned off by content that talks at them instead of with them. Consider how you would communicate with someone standing in front of you instead of via a traditional TV or radio advertisement.
10. Include valuable links.

If additional useful, relevant and appropriate content exists elsewhere—on or off your website—link to it. Instead of repeating information that already exists on your site, link to this content as well. Consider what content elsewhere might add value to yours and improve usability. When possible, include links within your page copy to make them contextually relevant.

You or someone you know wants to create content. Awesome! But to what end? Content strategy helps us plan for valuable, viable content.

We begin with publishing. To manage the digital workflow required to maintain an ever-increasing amount of content, publishers employ what’s (aptly) known as a content management system (CMS). It’s what we use behind the scenes at UX Booth.

Now, what if you or someone you know is getting ready to unleash content on the world. What might guide their creation efforts?

At this point, visual design—design of the actual website itself—is irrelevant. Nobody should really discuss what the system will look like (expect, maybe, the visual thinkers in the room), but instead, the heart of the matter: what’s this all about? What content will this website deliver? Moreover, when will the website deliver that content?

In this article, we’ll take a brief look at Content Strategy—that odd amalgamation of digital publishing, information architecture and editorial process that adds up to something infinitely greater than the sum of its parts. You’ll learn when and where to apply strategy to your content endeavors and when you should simply raise your hand and start asking (a lot of important) questions.

WHAT IS CONTENT STRATEGY?
“Content strategy plans for the creation, publication, and governance of useful, usable content,” says Kristina Halvorson, author of the book Content Strategy for the Web.

“It plots an achievable roadmap for individuals and organizations to create and maintain content that audiences will actually care about. It provides specific, well-informed recommendations about how we’re going to get from where we are today (no content, or bad content, or too much content) to where we want to be (useful, usable content people will actually care about).”

Taking a step back, Lou Rosenfeld adds:

“If [Information Architecture] is the spatial side of information, I see content strategy as the temporal side of the same coin.”

This abstraction is important: If Information Architecture helps us say “where” content lives, Content Strategy tells us decide “when” it lives. The combination, in due course, helps us as well as our clients understand “why” it’s there in the first place. And in case the connection isn’t clear: Lou is the guy behind the UX publishing house Rosenfeld Media. His company makes real, honest-to-goodness books. You can hold them in your hand.

So if I had to guess, Lou knows quite a bit about Content Strategy—even though he might not identify someone well-versed in it—because Content Strategy is part and parcel to the publishing world.

DIGITAL PUBLISHING
The distance between print and the web, when it comes to a prudent publication process, isn’t all that vast. In fact, if you think about all of the stuff required to publish books—authors, reviewers, technical editors, copy editors, publishers, graphic designers, distributors, etc.—you begin to see that their analogous roles on the web are just, by default, not designed into the process …at least, not when everyone and their mom can publish content.

Content Strategy is the way forward. It helps both clients and project teams understand what content is being produced, how it’s being produced, by whom, when, and why.

HOW IS CONTENT STRATEGY DONE
Kristina Halvorson, in her article The Discipline of Content Strategy, says that “at its best, a content strategy defines:

key themes and messages
recommended topics
content purpose (i.e., how content will bridge the space between audience needs and business requirements)
content gap analysis
metadata frameworks and related content attributes
search engine optimization (SEO), and
implications of strategic recommendations on content creation, publication, and governance.”
That means that, at their best, strategists will provide a document explaining how their teams will accomplish these goals.

Relly Annett-Baker, in her article Why you need a Content Strategist, points to a rough methodology:

 When we first meet, I ask a lot of questions about how your business works, what messages you want to get across and what your business’/products’ best features are. I look at (and sometimes create) the wireframes and the proposed information architecture of your website, consider interaction instructions, and [determine] whether a message is best explained with a screencast or a series of step-by-step by pictures.

THE CONTENT LIFECYCLE
Content, just like the websites they inhabit, are living, changing things. When strategists seek to assess and improve the quality of a website’s content, they typically follow a four-part process. The following diagram (used with permission) was created by Rahel Bailie while the descriptions of the phases were borrowed from Jonathan Kahn’s articles Content Strategy for the Web Professional:


ANALYZE
In this phase, strategists figure out what what kind of content they’re dealing with. Jonathan suggests: Ask questions about content, right from the start. Utilize user research or personas to decide what content is needed. Answer the question, “who cares?” Carry out a content audit, and/or a gap analysis.

COLLECT
Here we figure out (or plan for) the commonalities across our website’s content. Jonathan recommends: Establish key themes and messages. Write a plan for creating and commissioning content. Insist that the client plans for content production over time (an editorial calendar).

PUBLISH
In this phase, we’ll see our content through to publication: where does it live on the website and how does it get there? Jonathan recommends: Annotate wireframes and sitemaps to explain how both interaction and content will work. Specify CMS features like content models, metadata, and workflow based on the content strategy. Write and aggregate your killer content.

MANAGE
After we’ve published content, it’s time to look back, see what worked, and plan for the future. Jonathan says: Write comprehensive copy decks, based on common templates. Write a style guide for tone of voice, SEO, linking policy, and community policy.

## Media
## Microcopy & Meta Data


Never before in history has sending messages been as fast and broad as it is today. In an instant, you can message millions of people. Because of this fast paced message sending and receiving, there is little room for baloney. 

Welcome to microcopy. Due to today's increased rate of messaging, people are now scan text for the take away -- the key points of action. 

With microcopy, you can let people know what they need to know, and make sure they stay engaged with your page.

Here's my definition of microcopy:

Microcopy clearly communicates a unique message that keeps a user engaged in an experience while using as little words as possible.

I use the word unique because writing microcopy is more than just instructional guidance; microcopy takes a call to action and frames it within the context of your business. Writing microcopy uses words in the message that are relevant to the user's culture, so they can become familiar with the instructional or informational microcopy.

You see microcopy used in the following places:

The footer's copywrite claim
Loading screens
Calls to action
Form Instructions
Thank yous/Confirmations
Error messages/404's
So Why is Microcopy Important?

Imagine you're a guy taking a girl out on a dinner date.

The product in this situation is you (I realize you're not an object, but bear with me).

:-)

Your outfit is the copy. You spent time getting all spiffy in order to present yourself well. 

The thing you do to surprise her, like bring her roses or take her someone special after dinner, is part of the whole dating process. These are your headlines, subheads, transitions, and so on. 

Now, let's talk about the subtle things you do, like opening up the door, pulling out her chair, complimenting her on something unique. This is microcopy. It's when you can communicate in short messages and lead someone toward a goal. 

You've done a good job selling your product. 

Congratulations. 

By providing short "queues" of information, you keep a person engaged with the things you want to keep them engaged in. 

Here's a way to write better microcopy.

Create a Dialog

People fail at microcopy when they treat people like pegs on a board. Users are people who want to trust you and use your product. 

One of the ways to respect your user is to create a cleaner line of communication with them. You can do this by being suggestive instead of authoritative with your microcopy. For example, let's say you are writing microcopy on a form. Let's be honest, forms are boring. Going to the DMV or any other place where you have to fill out a form isn't exactly something to look forward to. But forms be slightly more interesting if they use microcopy that creates a dialog, rather than a one way form of communication.

One way to create a dialog in forms is to ask questions instead of using authoritative statements. You can use "What is your name?" instead of "INPUT NAME HERE". You can use "What do you do?" instead of "INSERT JOB TITLE HERE". And lastly, you use "All Done?" as a submit button instead of "SUBMIT".

Keep it Simple

Keeping it simple is my favorite writing rule. And just because you keep it simple, it doesn't mean that it lacks depth. Take for example this six word story by Hemingway:

For sale: baby shoes, never worn

In as little as six words, your mind starts to think about what has happened. Writing microcopy for your business works well when you communicate effectively while using a small number of words.

Here are some things that you should consider when it comes to writing better microcopy for your business

If you can't describe your business in a tweet (140 characters), reconsider your business.
If you can't summarize what your business does in 10 seconds, reconsider your business.
And most importantly, when it comes to microcopy on your site, if you can't explain what you want the user to do at any point in your site in eight words or less, reconsider the design. 
Writing effective and simple microcopy is about using it microcopy as a guide, not a guidebook. You want the microcopy to take you from place to place, not bombard you with too much information.

Keep it in Sync

One of the ways microcopy differs from site to site is it will use certain branding elements. Keeping microcopy in sync means that you should follow the brand's theme in the microcopy whenever possible, but you should keep in mind that it's important not to get too carried away. While writing branded microcopy is fun, you have to remember microcopy serves a higher goal.

Places where you want to avoid over-branded microcopy:

Navigation,
Forms and Field Labels
Instructions
Selections (drop-downs, radio buttons, etc.)
Buttons.
Places where you can have fun with branded microcopy:

Confirmations
Rewards (points, etc.)
404 Pages
Server Errors
Error Messaging
Wrapping Up

Having effective microcopy is just as important to your business as any other part of the copy. 

When adding branding or humor into your microcopy, you are taking a risk. Too much branding/humor can make you appear as someone that doesn't their business seriously. A little is okay, but don't overdo it. If you decide to dress up your microcopy, understand that it may not please everyone.

	Understanding & Designing Great Microcopy | Tips
webdesignledger.com · by Jake Rocheleau · December 8, 2014
We all know about the importance of great copy on the web. It’s often easy to capture attention with visuals but strenuous to capture attention with verbiage. So if the word “copy” refers to the overall page text, then what’s microcopy? Well much like finding a great parking spot in a crowded plaza, microcopy refers to the little things that make a big impact.

Microcopy is littered throughout every website to explain features, interfaces, and minute details. The exact diction used in a signup form can make a world of difference. In this post I’d like to cover a brief overview of microcopy and how you can design better interfaces by focusing more on the unique pattern of words.

Effective Microcopy

The most important thing to remember is that people actually do read this stuff. The iTunes Terms of Service is so heavily ignored that you could hide a dead body in there and nobody would ever find it. But when talking about real interactive page elements the text matters. Think about loading screens, signup forms, confirmation or thank you e-mails. Even if people don’t read every word they usually skim to at least capture the essence of the message.

Crafting effective microcopy is about staying true to the website’s theme while delivering information. A 404 page could be funny, charismatic, detailed, or pragmatic and straightforward. The style of writing also defines how much should be written. Sometimes a little humor can alleviate the potential stress of an error message. When used in the right context it becomes a memorable experience for the user.

Another thing to remember is that context really does matter. When writing page copy it’s more about location, design, formatting, and really conveying the message. With microcopy you also want to get the message across but it’s more contextual. This means you could use almost any design style(within reason) as long as the text is relatable to the situation.

There’s also a reason this text is called “micro” copy. Yes the obvious answer is because the text is used in smaller areas of the page. But purposefully or ironically the text itself is typically microsized. Keep the word count low because users are more easily drawn towards quick snippets of text than large paragraphs.

It shouldn’t matter whether you’re a published novelist or if you barely understand the difference between “you’re” and “your”. Stay in the mindset of a new user and think of what message would be the most useful in certain contexts. This train of thought will help you detach from the design and focus more on usability.

Write for Common Sense

Something that may be common sense to the designer or developer of a website is not always common sense to the user. Microcopy is made up of phrases – a few words or a sentence which completely changes the tone of user interaction. Clarification only gets annoying when it’s done repeatedly copying the same advice over and over.

But clarifying a potentially confusing interface only reaps benefits. You might skim a related and useful microcopy article written by Joshua Porter which expands on a few ideas. The gist is to sleuth out problems with the experience that might cause users to hesitate or back out of the interaction. This could be with any type of webform from a signup page to a search field or profile update screen.

Microcopy always relates to decision making. It’s a volatile moment when someone is debating whether to checkout with their shopping cart or just leave the page and purchase another day. Great microcopy will help customers build confidence with each purchase and leave with a smile on their face. It’s about building UX confidence and offering clarity to some of the more daunting tasks.

Reducing Concerns

Users who are more confident about their choices will leave your site with a delicious taste in their mouth. In contradistinction users who are concerned or confused with their actions might leave with a more anxious, bitter taste. Can you guess which option is better?

The goal of microcopy is to streamline the user experience. This in turn builds confidence with each click or keystroke because the user’s concerns have been put to rest. Well-written microcopy will mitigate problems ranging from all areas of miscommunication. Remember to stay out of your head and get into the head of a typical visitor.

If you’re researching ideas try interacting with a few different websites. You might try signing up for an account then editing your new profile to look for any problematic areas. Interact with a website that behaves similarly to your own – look at what they do right and what they do wrong. Avoiding bad microcopy is easier said than done. But once you recognize great microcopy it all becomes much clearer.

Be efficient with your word choices and have a purpose for each phrase. You don’t need grammatically complete sentences for each piece of microcopy as long as you’re improving the user experience. We’re not writing a scientific dissertation on dark matter so there are no sacred grammatical rules when it comes to microcopy structure.

Are You Human?

We all love CAPTCHAs right? Well perhaps love isn’t the right word… more like tolerable. They’re tolerable because they provide a real solution to spam management. While there are other solutions beyond CAPTCHAs they aren’t as effective at stopping spam. However the problem with CAPTCHAs is that they’re not great at communicating with the user.

If someone can’t read the CAPTCHA text they just need to guess and hope for the best. When it comes back incorrect they’ll need to guess again in a vicious cycle to complete a form they might not even care about. Spam management techniques may not be up for debate, but for every other part of a form you should endeavor towards a more humane experience.

The best microcopy doesn’t sound like a computer-generated response. Quick little messages shouldn’t evoke frustration in the same vein of a PC load letter. Writing microcopy that relates to a user is as simple as treating them like humans. Write phrases and sentences that talk to the user as if they’re having a conversation with the interface.

While this style of writing is relatable to the user it also provides evidence that a real human took the time to write and build the website. In our age of technological attachment sometimes it feels like our lives are surrounded by machines. It’s easy to forget that real people with feelings and underwear drawers created all of these machine interfaces. Microcopy written from the perspective of a human being provides a more authentic connection to the interface and user experience.

Closing

Overall the practice of writing microcopy is more intuitive than analytical. Yes there is a need to analyze each situation to find problematic areas. But thinking about what to write is difficult if you only focus on logic and rule out emotions. I hope these ideas can provide a springboard for designers looking to craft less bewildering and more usable interfaces. Microcopy isn’t always given the appreciation it deserves but it still plays a big part in the creation of usable websites.


	### Content Marketing

Now that we are in the start of a brand new year, you might be asking yourself what marketing tactics you will implement for your brand in 2015. You know about all of the Internet marketing techniques, from social media marketing to building links. However, content marketing has been buzzing as a top-notch marketing strategy for quite a while now, and the hype has yet to fade away. Maybe there is something to this content marketing thing after all?

Not only is there something to content marketing, it will be one of the most vitally important marketing strategies in 2015. Sure, link building and social media is not going away. But it is undeniable that content is the driving force behind building links and succeeding on social—we’ll touch back on that later.

So, exactly how important will content marketing be in 2015? Here’s a breakdown as to why it will be one of the best marketing decisions you will make this year and beyond.

Content Marketing Is Important in 2015 Because Google Says So

The majority of digital marketers are all about pleasing the almighty Google. With that said, it is no secret that Google wants to provide its users with the best quality content that’s found around the web. In fact, Google finds content marketing important enough to base algorithm updates around the strategy.

Pass the Panda Test With Quality Content Marketing

Google’s Panda update is centralized around ensuring that quality content wins on Google. You might think that you are safe from Panda if you are not creating any content at all, but that’s not exactly the case. In fact, Panda actually penalizes websites that sit stale. Panda looks for fresh and quality content; if you aren’t delivering on the freshness factor, don’t look for any sympathy from Panda.

You Won The Battle With Panda, But What About Penguin?

Even if you are delivering fresh content to your audience on a regular basis, this does not mean that everything is smooth sailing. Google’s Penguin update targets spammy websites, which points to content that is low quality and over optimized.

If you are writing content with no regard for quality, prepare for Penguin’s penalty. Keyword-stuffed blog posts that are littered with low quality links will put you on the fast track to disappearing from the SERPs. Overcoming Penguin’s penalties is not impossible, but it is notoriously difficult.

Stay on The Safe Side of 2015 Google Updates With Content Marketing

Although nothing is guaranteed with Google, you can surely help your case by implementing a quality content marketing strategy. Producing compelling and useful content on a regular basis will keep both Panda and Penguin out of your hair. Not to mention, you will sleep a lot better at night knowing that if an update hits, your search engine rankings will likely stay the same or even improve.

Instead of dreading Google’s regular algorithm updates and looking over your shoulder, plan for a smart content marketing strategy in 2015.

Planning Ahead: 2 Smart Content Marketing Strategies

Now that you understand why content marketing is vital to dodging Google’s penalties, we’re outlining a few strategies to get the most out of your content in 2015.

1. Start From The Top: Content Auditing

If you already have a website that has a little (or a lot) of content, plan on doing a content audit in 2015. Content audits are used to find areas where your current content is lacking. It also helps you find gaps where you need new content. Either way, content audits are essential for stretching your strategy far as possible.

Quick Tips For Smart Content Auditing. Content audits don’t have to be a drag. They can take a bit of time, but keep in mind that they can help improve your search engine rankings while increasing the quality of your content.

Furthermore, audits can help you detect over-optimized content that can lead to penalties from Google. Here are a few quick auditing tips to get your content audit started off on the right foot:

·      Evaluate the length of your content. When you are looking at general website content, aim to have at least 350-500 words per page. If your word count is too short, Google may not index content at all if it is considered as too thin.

·      Beef up those blog posts. On the other hand, blog posts are a little different in terms of content length. This is because blog posts are more about engagement, while standard product and service pages stand as general user information. While a 500-word blog post won’t result in any negative consequences, you will be further ahead to increase that word count to at least 1500. Longer blog posts boost engagement levels and keep your audience on your website for longer periods of time.

·      Consider its purpose. Is your content answering your customer’s questions? Does it provide value in one way or another? If it is not serving a need, it’s time to either eliminate it or add fresh content for an update.

·      Use tools to your advantage. If you happen to use Wordpress as your publisher, you’re in luck. Wordpress offers a free plugin called Yoast that analyzes your blogs and pages for SEO value. If you have yet to install this plugin, give it a go to maximize your auditing efforts.

·      Keep keywords to a minimum. Keywords are still important in 2015, but too much of a good thing can backfire. Use your Yoast tool to determine the best keyword density for your content.

2. Curating Content: Something to Talk About. One of the challenges of content marketing is figuring out exactly what to say. Content curation fills that gap while providing fresh content on a regular basis. While curating content is not a substitute to eliminating your original content efforts all together, it serves as a supplement to your overall content strategy.

Quick Tips to Curating Content. Curating content is on the rise for 2015, and here are several quick tips to get started on curating the right way:

·      Invest in efficient curation tools. Manually curating content can take a while, but there are tools to help you save time. Content curation tools like Scoop.it can maximize your efforts by bringing you the best content on the web at the click of a button.

·      Search social. There are several go-to platforms for finding hot topics, one being Quora. Quora is a community-based question and answer website that has topics relating to almost any niche. You might have to dig a bit, but it is free to use and has a lot of great topics and ideas.

·      Always add your own insight. Although curating content might seem like a game of copy and paste, there’s a bit more to it than that. The best strategy for curating content is adding your own expert insight; be sure to credit your original source, and write out a few thought-worthy comments about the subject at hand.

Content marketing in itself can help you steer clear from Panda and Penguin, but it’s important to do things the right way from the beginning. These quick tips for content auditing and curating can help you maximize the efficiency of your 2015 content marketing strategy.

6 Ways Content Marketing Gets You Ahead in 2015

You already know that content marketing gets you ahead of Google’s inevitable updates. However, there are many other important roles that content marketing plays in 2015.

1.    Content Marketing Establishes Your Brand. Brand awareness is crucial for establishing yourself in 2015. Gaining the trust of potential customers can be an uphill battle, and operating as an unknown brand turns a mole hole into a mountain. Luckily, content marketing offers a way around that mountain.

Content marketing can establish your brand as a trusted source of go-to information. This can be accomplished both through curating and original content. If your brand can satisfy the needs of your customers on a content level, you can be sure that they will remember you when they’re ready to buy in the future.

2.    Content Marketing Boosts Your Website Rankings. If your website’s ranking matters to you whatsoever, content marketing puts you in a position of SEO power in 2015. With Google placing more value on content marketing now than ever before, quality content will have a direct impact on your website’s search engine rankings.

3.    Content Marketing Conquers Link Building. Remember the link building comment that I made earlier? This is where link building – well, links – to content marketing. Link building is one of the primary factors to ranking well on Google, but building quality links doesn’t happen at the snap of a finger.

The driving force behind link building is content. Although quality content does not guarantee an endless amount of inbound links, it will up your chances of obtaining them. People tend to link to quality content that is relevant and educates.

4.    Content Marketing Drives Social Engagement. If you are like most other companies, chances are that you’re using social media in one form of another. When you think about it, social media is content marketing. Even if you only write a sentence or two, you still have to put thought into your tweets and statuses. You also have to ask yourself how your comments will help your audience, and if what you are saying is relevant.

Not only that, but content itself is what goes viral on social media. Think videos, popular blog posts, news articles, and more. Social media is like a vessel that carries content to the hands of your audience.

5.    Content Marketing Makes You a Thought Leader. Those who invest time and effort into content marketing are the trailblazers of their industry. In order to be a thought leader, your content must be original, useful, and on-point with the needs of your audience.

Content marketing can help brands achieve thought leader status by implementing smart strategies. Publish content on a regular basis, engage your audience, and build a rock-solid reputation with content marketing.

6.    Content Marketing Keeps You on Top of Industry Trends. In order to be a smart content marketer, it is vital that you remain current on all industry trends. This forces you to set aside time each day or week to review hot topics in your industry. Not only does this benefit your brand for content marketing, but it also helps keep you educated about your own industry.

Overall, Content Marketing Just Makes Sense

We all know that investing in new marketing techniques can be a gamble. Even though every industry has its own techniques that work best for marketing, you can almost never go wrong with content.

Those who invest in content marketing can win big, but only if they do it correctly. The kind of content that is important to implement in 2015 is:

·      Engaging: The best kind of content is the kind that provokes and engages. If your content is not stimulating in one way or another, it will be difficult to reap the real benefits of content marketing.

·      Educational: Panda 4.1 has proved to us that educational content wins big in the search engines. Education is valuable, so creating content that educates your audience is key to winning with Google.

·      Fresh And Timely: When it comes to content marketing, timing is everything. Keep your content fresh and ahead of the curve every week. Stale content not only looks bad to your audience, but it can also negatively impact your ranking on Google.

·      Answering Questions: Hammering home the question/answer topic, this kind of content marketing always scores with your audience. Answering the needs of your audience will keep them coming back for more.

Content marketing has been important for branding ever since the days of the printing press. This is no exception to 2015, as content marketing’s relevancy and value only continues to increase on a yearly basis. From establishing a solid reputation, to drumming up social media engagement and becoming a thought leader, content marketing is of utmost importance in 2015 and beyond.

Tips for Creating Content
Before You Begin
Before you begin creating written and visual content for a website, ask yourself these questions:
Who is your audience? Who are trying to reach with your message?
What is your message? What are you trying to get across?
What should happen after this message is delivered? What are your goals?
Remember the Visitor has Come to Your Site for a Reason
Visitors have something they want to do when they come to your website. They are there either to do an action or to find information. It is your job to anticipate what they will want to do and help them to do it.
Your Visitor is in a Hurry
Time is valuable, and visitors to your website want to find what they are looking for and move on quickly. If they cannot do this, you risk losing them.
Most Visitors Scan Websites, They don't Read Every Word
Research shows that the majority of people scan Web copy, looking for key words or phrases. You must make your content conducive to scanning. That means breaking it into small, easily accessible and readable chunks. Headlines and subheads can further break up the content. Use bulleted lists instead of long, comma delimited lists.
Put the Important Content First
Don't bury your important information under several paragraphs of filler content. Keep top-level content simple and to the point and provide links to allow visitors to "drill down" to more specific items. Lead with your most important content, then elaborate. This will help your visitor find what they are looking for.
Use Links within Your Text
Incorporate your links within your text, rather than using phrases such as "click here" or "more." Having a sentence or a phrase as a link will make it clear to your visitor exactly what is going to happen when they click it.
Keep it Simple
The median reading level for an average American is the 8th grade. Also English is not the first language of many of our visitors. Finally, simple pages lend themselves to scanning. The following guidelines will help you help your visitors.
Keep your content simple and straightforward
Use terms your visitor will understand
Avoid jargon, overly formal language or highly technical terms at the highest levels of your site (These terms may be acceptable on lower level pages within the site, such as faculty pages or research-related pages, whose audiences will expect to find the language.)
Use keywords that your visitor will expect to find
Keep it Short
Use as few words as possible in your content. Keep your writing tight.
Proofread and Edit Your Copy
Check your facts and your spelling. Do not only rely on a computer spelling or grammar checker. Have somebody who is unfamiliar with your content check it for accuracy. It may be helpful to print your pages and proofread them away from the computer, as mistakes are often easier to find.
Writing Points of Emphasis
Abbreviations and Acronyms
You may use abbreviations that are common in standard English, such as site names (e.g., St. Louis), or names of states (use postal abbreviations, e.g. "CA" for California).
Avoid using non-standard or UCR-specific abbreviations.
Acronyms for facilities are not acceptable on first mentions, but may be used in subsequent mentions. For example: "The College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (CHASS) is the largest college at UCR. CHASS oversees..."
Bulleted Lists (Changed December 22, 2008)
These should be used whenever you are listing a large number of items, particularly if the items are links.
Here are the rules for creating a bulleted list:
Bullet lists should be introduced with a sentence which is closed with a colon.
The first word in a bulleted items is always capitalized.
The punctuation on the bulleted list depends upon the nature of the text. Complete sentences, or phrases that would complete a sentence when combined with the introduction, receive a period.
There may be multiple periods in a bulleted item.
Phrases that are not complete sentences or are part of a list do not require a period.
Copyright Violations
All information, images and intellectual properties are protected by law. Even though it may be easier to directly copy from another site, do not do so unless you get written permission from the site owner.
Dates and Times
The proper format is "a.m." and "p.m.", not capitalized and with periods. Days of the week and months of the year should be spelled out. 12 noon and 12 midnight should be noted as such, not 12 a.m. or 12 p.m.
Headlines
They should be up style. E.g. UCR Revamps Website. Capitalization of all words, except for internal articles, prepositions, conjunctions and forms of to be (e.g. "is"). In general, when using the content management system, any headers H1 through H3 should be in up-style. H4 and below should be in down style.
Section Headlines should be no more than five to seven words and should not be in title case (capitalized).
Headlines should be compelling, simple and straightforward. Get to the point and state facts. Do not fall into the trap of trying to be clever.
Numbers
In keeping with AP style, numbers lower than 10 should be spelled out. All two-digit or greater numbers should be presented numerically.
Publication Titles
Titles of publications should be italicized. This is different than the print standard. For example:
The Maltese Falcon by Dashiell Hammett
The Supremes' Greatest Hits by Michael G. Trachtman
Gone With the Wind
"You"
Write in the first and second person when possible. Using "you" and other first person words personalizes your website for your visitor.
Keywords
The phrases and underlined keywords are themes that our research shows our core audiences believe important. These themes should influence the your content as applicable.

These messages will help market the campus in a subtle fashion as your visitor finds the information they are looking for.
Remember that these are concepts and ideas. Not all of them will necessarily apply to your content, nor must they all appear on every page. Use them in a way that will advantage your organization and the University as a whole.

	### Content Audits

When it comes to revising the content on a website many recommend starting with an audit. On one level this makes a lot of sense. Look at what you have and revise accordingly. But, on another level this is the wrong approach.

My problem is that this starts from the organisations point of the view, rather than that of the user. It starts by saying, what content do we have that we want to share? Sure, it may need rewriting to be more ‘user friendly’ but it still makes one massive assumption. That users care about that content in the first place.
