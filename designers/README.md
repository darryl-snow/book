What differentiates web design from other disciplines of design? There are the obvious ones: it's modular, it must be adaptable to different states, interactions, and contexts, and it has an entire technological component that greatly affects execution.

For most of my career I’ve had to battle designers creating incredibly unrealistic best-case scenario mock-ups. You know what I’m talking about. The user’s name is “Sara Smith” and always fits neatly on one line. Her profile picture looks like it was clipped out of a magazine. Her profile is completely filled out. The two columns of her profile content magically are exactly the same height. Of course these best-case scenarios rarely, if ever, occur in the real world.In order to create more robust and resilient designs, we need to concurrently account for the best situations, the worst, and everything in between.

Reponsibility to uncover users' problems, habits, and motivations, and then design to match those findings.

You may be excited about the initial design direction, but in the end it has to add value to the project, aside from pure aesthetics. If it doesn't make the project more valuable then doesn't make it easier for people to use. Designers' jobs is to create beautiful products, but also to make them usable and powerful.

When working on something new, prototype new ideas and create interactive concepts in the browser, thus reducing the likelihood of miscommunication about what will change when pieces are made interactive.

The web is continuing to distance itself from the outdated "page" metaphor, and more and more design systems are emerging. These design systems are often concretely established by the creation of a CSS style guide. As the guide becomes more robust, gaps get filled during development. Look at reflowing content on different devices. A static example cannot be visualised when content reflows from portrait to landscape. Interaction will trump documentation. To show how a responsive design works, nothing tells the story as effectively as opening a browser and squishing and expanding the viewport in front of someone. Plus, getting the design in code brings added efficiencies, such as showing off CSS animations and showing active, focus, and hover states.

Design is the process of creating a solution that balances the goals of both the user and the creator. User goals include both tasks people need to get done and psychological wants. Creator goals include qualitative and quantitative goals that we call "design" and "data" goals, respectively. Explicitly stating and balancing these different goals is the most important part of design. Without goals, you're not aiming correctly, so you have very little chance of hitting the target.

I'm reminded of a Hemmingway quote: "take out the good parts and see if it still works". If you like something too much to throw it away when it's outlived its use, that's a problem. No matter how enamoured we might be with an idea, or a feature, or an implementation, (or a whole site!), it's good to step back occasionally and see if it still makes sense. And if not - to act.

Adding a mockup for every breakpoint isn't a sustainable approach.

Working with sketches on paper is powerful because it allows you to go fast. It's probably the only medium where you can record ideas as fast as they happen. It allows you to present yourself with visual options instead of just things in your head, and then make better informed design decisions. Often putting two options on paper, even in the most rough form, will make it obvious which one is better.


So what does it take to design a successful digital product or service? Is it the brand, the chosen platform, the functionality, the choice of colors, or some viral features? All of the above have some importance but no single element is why company X is a success. We’re often attached to the idea that if you just get the right idea or if your design is cool or uses a certain technology, we will be successful - there is no recipe for success.

Take the design process seriously, but don’t get too attached to one particular part of it and don’t rely on any one particular discipline to give you the right answers. Get to the point where you have real users or customers as quickly as possible. It’s these users that will provide you with the information that will get you in a position to make better design decisions.

### PLAN A LITTLE - DO THE REST
An important part of building great products consistently has to do with planning. A few questions that you may want to answer before jumping too far into the details:

* Who are the core users?
* What are the user needs and goals?
* What are the business needs and goals?
* What existing product or design patterns work for your users and business?
* What are the gaps in what’s currently out there?
* What are some product requirements you have given your users needs and goals (as well as those of your business?
* What are your constraints (i.e. time, resources, money, skills)

Don’t spend too much time on this upfront because sketching, wireframing and prototyping will help you refine your understanding of the answers to these questions. But they’re important to have in the back of your mind throughout the process.

### START WITH USERS - AND THEIR NEEDS
“Who is going to use my product and what will he or she do first?”

So many people never answer this question or answer it too late in the design process. They start to add boxes, text, colors, and images in a way that makes sense to them. This is great if you’re the actual user. But you often aren’t. Chamath Palihapitiya shares this sentiment when talking about building a product that grows - talk to your users and know your users.

The difference between art and design is that design solves a problem. The design process must start with identifying and thinking about real user needs. You should design around those individual needs and user flows to satisfy those needs. In order to do so, you must understand those needs thoroughly - interrogating data, not just making assumptions - and remember that what users ask for is not always what they need.

The average person - your users - has an okay life. It’s not as amazing or glamorous as it seems in the movies, TV or social media. They’re not getting made, paid or laid as much as they want. And they don’t care about anything you’ve built unless it makes their life better. Don’t forget that while you’re getting lost in boxes, text, colors, and images.

### START SIMPLE, STAY SIMPLE
Wireframe only what you and, more importantly, your users need.

Constrain yourself. A good product has limitations. It doesn’t just succumb to every temptation that comes along. Only add features if you get clear signs that it is needed. It cannot be said enough. Less is more – much more, and for very good reasons:

First, if you do less you can measure more. And if you can measure more, you can better experiment with what works. Most products are simple, based on simple insights - and the product teams behind them have made many small variations of those products in the process.
Second, most users will have to learn your product anyway so don’t try to impress them with features before they understand what your product is all about. Don’t add new features just because you think that it will help, it wont, not yet. If your product becomes a success it’s not because of how many features it has.
Finally, you’ll save more money by focusing resources where they’ll do the most good.
Dropbox leaves much to be desired, Mailbox is pretty basic, Spotify still has a way to go, Pinterest could be so much more robust, and Uber could have way more bells and whistles. But they’re all rock-solid products with focused features for focused user needs and use cases.

### DON’T CONFUSE CHANGE WITH IMPROVEMENT
One of the biggest challenges faced by designers, artists, and generally creative people when producing new work is fatigue. They get this from reviewing their work and their inspirations - every minute detail - over and over and over. Top tech companies and startups have similar problems - largely due to the intensity and time spent immersed in them.

It’s very tempting after a couple of months of looking at the same design to want to change it, and think you are improving your product. Make sure you stay focused on things that really improve the product and make your users even more happy, acquire more users, convert them and so on - whatever your product objectives are. If you end up making changes that don’t improve - or, more commonly, hurt - the product, you’ll have to spend resources on changing things after you launch.

### EVERYTHING HAS A MEANING
Your product sketches, wireframes, and prototypes are methods of communicating just like any language in the world. Every piece of text, color, gradient, shadow, shape, and image you put down has a meaning, just like there are definitions for every word.

A frequent issue I see with wireframes and prototypes is the variety of colors or grayscale shades, line weights, font types, and element sizing or layout - all without much thought, if any. This adds confusion as you don’t know whether these slight variations should translate to variations in the end-product and, if so, what they will communicate. It’s as if someone did graphic design without a style guide, or someone spoke the English language without ever reading a page of the Oxford English Dictionary.

### BE CONSISTENT, NOT UNIFORM
Wherever possible, use the same language and design patterns to help familiarize users with your product. But, when this isn’t possible, you should at least make sure your underlying approach is consistent so your users can reasonably guess what they’re supposed to do.

Presumably, you hope they use the product very often - hourly, daily, or weekly - so you’re helping them get comfortable doing so. You’re also helping them develop habits that will pay dividends down the road - all while going about their daily lives.

Granted, you can’t imagine every scenario and write rules for it like a design style guide. Every circumstance is different and should be addressed on its own terms. What unites things, therefore, should be a consistent approach - one that users will hopefully come to understand and trust.

As this pertains to sketching, wireframing and prototyping, it’s a valuable discipline to limit the palette of shapes, colors, text, and graphics initially. This will help you be consistent without being totally uniform (and arguably boring) or having too much going on, which could be wildly confusing. As a rule of thumb, I always suggest limiting each attribute (color, grayscale shades, text, elements, etc.) to 2-3 variations so you’re comparing apples to apples instead of wondering which variation is an apple, and which one is something else - could be an orange or a lemon. This will result in a less “sexy” wireframe, but that’s not the purpose of a wireframe - leave that for mockups and high-fidelity prototypes.

What’s nice about sketching is that you only have one color and font everywhere until you physically decide to switch sketching tools (i.e. a thicker marker or a colored pencil). Similarly, wireframing tools also limit your options for line weight, color and font types. While wireframing and prototyping tools like UXPin http://uxpin.com/ give you more flexibility, other tools like Balsamiq are extremely limiting for this precise reason. Compared to graphic editing and presentation software, however, most wireframing software will help you more with staying consistent throughout the design process.

### LOW-FIDELITY DOESN’T MEAN UNREALISTIC
When possible, add the details you know you’ll need, even if they’re rough approximations.

It’s better than putting in arbitrary fillers you may change dramatically - which will ultimately change your design. One of the most common requests I get from designers when working together is content - real content. In 50 Shades of Wireframing, I emphasized the value of having higher-fidelity for text, colors, media, and interactions depending on which details will have the greatest impact on the overall product design.

At my last company, I had to actually think about whether my product summary paragraphs were going to be 3 or 6 lines long because the bulk of those paragraphs may change the overall look, feel, and emphasis on the page given the existing layout - and, therefore, the layout would have to be re-considered for the product design. If I’m including product photos, I have to see the photos - or at least an approximation - before I can decide whether to include it, make it a primary feature or fight against it. The truth is that headings wrap, videos can be distracting or even creepy, photo dimensions and orientations can be inconvenient, and decimals don’t creep out of their input boxes.

So scrap the “Lorem Ipsum” and get realistic about what you’re trying to convey to your users as early as possible.

### EXPERIMENT & COLLABORATE QUICKLY
The best way to build effective products is to start small and iterate wildly. Iteration reduces risk. It makes big failures unlikely and turns small failures into lessons. This avoids the 200 page spec document which can turn into a bottleneck.

Low-fidelity design helps you and your team to explore many potential solutions quickly before focusing in on one solution and polishing and refining it into the final product. Initially, it may appear there are many solutions to a design challenge. However, you can only decide which will work best after exploring a few of them and laying them out in front of you - to see, touch and feel. Inexperienced designers will over-commit to their initial ideas and fall in love with what is likely the wrong solution - good designers know better.

Ultimately, you’re working in the wrong fidelity if you can’t product concepts quickly. And you’re wasting precious time if your wireframes are just grayscale versions of a design you already have your heart set on. Use wireframing as a means to an end, not the end itself.

### YOUR DESIGNS WILL GET BUILT
A great design can be a terrible solution.

Remember that every animation, box, button, menu, modal window, photo gallery, and map view needs to be programmed - and you can draw a lot faster than anyone in the world can code. If you know HTML/CSS/JS, and you’ve seen what it takes to test a page across every web browser, you’ll try to find an easier way to solve your users’ problems when designing wireframes. Every project has budgetary, time, and resource constraints, and you should internalize that with everything you add to your wireframes, even little components - there are no small changes, and there’s a trade-off for every decision you make.

Accounting for Variation

What if the user doesn’t upload a profile picture? What if the user has 87 items in their cart? What if the product has 14 options? What if the blog post title contains 40 characters? What if it has 400 characters instead? Return user? First-time user? What if this article doesn’t contain an image? What if we need to display an urgent message?

These “what if” questions are important to ask throughout the entire design process. Historically though, these questions often only get brought up late in the game after wireframes and comps have been approved and are in the process of being implemented. This is both a process and a tool issue.

I’ve seen these issues repeatedly come up when teams don’t treat development as an essential part of the design process. Because developers live through the nightmare of having to fill in the gaps themselves, they’re typically pretty good at asking those “what if” questions. Treating developers as equal members of the design team can prevent those antagonistic relationships–the ones where developers scold designers for creating unrealistic things and where designers argue with developers for being difficult and incompetent. I hope you don’t know what I’m talking about here, but you probably do.

Processes is one issue, but our current crop of design tools are often poorly equipped to deal with dynamic content. Static tools like Photoshop paint a pretty picture, but trying to create a ton of variations incurs a tremendous amount of work. And while I’ve seen clever people do interesting dynamic things with static wireframing tools, they ultimately just add more pages to a PDF that will ultimately be discarded. Ok then, so into the browser we go. Wireframing in the browser can give us a more realistic idea of the Web environment, but it doesn’t intrinsically solve the dynamic content issue. So how do we solve that?

Dynamic Design Is Awesome

The Web is dynamic, so it’s essential for us to design with these important “what if” questions in mind. We must move away from leaving those questions to the very end of our process if we want to create more thoughtful, realistic, resilient designs.

MISTAKES TO AVOID WITH RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN:

* DON’T DESIGN FOR DESKTOP FIRST
* THE TROUBLE WITH NAVIGATION MENUS
* CONTENT SHOULDN’T BE HIDDEN
* SEPARATE MOBILE URLS
* CREATING POOR MOBILE UX
* DON’T DISREGARD CROSS-CONTEXTUAL CONVENTIONS
* DON’T IGNORE PAGE LOAD TIMES
* NOT DEVELOPING FOR TOUCHSCREEN DEVICES

http://modernweb.com/2014/07/02/mistakes-avoid-responsive-web-design/

For the first few years of my career, I didn’t know that wireframes existed. It wasn’t until I started working at a larger agency that I first encountered a strange new black-and-white InDesign world, where multiple rounds of 100+ page PDFs were generated and presented to clients.

While a lot of great thinking goes into these highly-detailed wireframes, the actual artifact creates a lot of issues.

Problems with High-Fidelity Static Wireframes

“When someone hands you a flyer, it’s like they’re saying ‘here, you throw this away’.” –Mitch Hedberg
They’re abstractions – High-fidelity wireframes are huge unrealistic abstractions. They’re fixed width, they can’t demonstrate interactivity, and they kill trees. Generating mountains of full-blown PSD comps doesn’t make much sense anymore, and I’d say spending a lot of time generating a bunch of fixed-width, non-interactive wireframes doesn’t make much sense either.
They’re full of assumptions – High-fidelity wireframes make all sorts of assumptions about layout, aesthetic design, source order, and more. In my experience, the people generating these wireframes don’t come from a front-end or visual design background, so these documents end up limiting the design and technical possibilities.
They’re verbose – This doesn’t have to be the case, but I’ve worked on many projects where high-fidelity wireframes were unnecessarily detailed and explained things that should really be demonstrated. The annotations looked like book chapters. “Call me Ishmael. When the user hovers over the dropdown, it exposes…”
They’re a crutch – Writing book chapter-length annotations is a incredibly poor substitute for actually communicating and collaborating with clients and colleagues. No one discipline has all the answers. It’s increasingly important to encourage real conversation and collaboration rather than having a verbose document do your talking for you.
Lo-fi All the Way

“Ideas want to be ugly.” –Jason Santa Maria
While high-fidelity wireframes have all sorts of downsides, they’re ultimately trying answer the questions “What should go on this screen and in what general order?”

These are obviously important questions to ask, and thankfully we don’t need to get too high-fidelity in order to arrive at some answers. Sketching is an incredibly powerful way of getting ideas out quickly, and gives you, your clients, and colleagues an opportunity to have conversations around your content without wading too far into the weeds.

Jason Santa Maria has been talking about a gray box method of wireframing for a long while now, and the idea is to simply block out the content in gray boxes to define the content and its general hierarchy.

This gives us an opportunity to ask the client “Hey, is everything present and accounted for? Are things generally in the right order based on importance?” And while the content will naturally evolve over time, we didn’t need to sink a whole lot of time into these wireframes to establish a good direction.

HTML Wireframes

It’s a good idea to create wireframes in the browser, and I’m happy that smart folks like Matt Griffin agree. Here are some of the many benefits of wireframing in HTML:

They get into the browser quicker – Right out of the gate, wireframing in HTML lets you, your teammates, and clients interact with your interface in its final environment. You can fire up HTML wireframes on devices, which gives you a more realistic sense of how the design feels.
They reinforce the notion that you’re creating a website – When PDFs, JPEGs and other static artifacts get thrown around, there’s a tendency to forget the medium for which you’re designing. Clients end up printing out these artifacts and writing in the margins like it’s a brochure. HTML wireframes reinforce the fact that you’re creating something that will be live on the Web.
They’re interactive – Clients and colleagues can step through a flow using hyperlinks, which is a hell of a lot more realistic than “please turn to page 65″ in a PDF. And once you’re a bit further down the road, you can more easily demonstrate interactions like active states, dropdowns, motion, etc.
They allow for living, breathing annotations–Annotations in static wireframes often get lost in the sands of time over the course of the project. That’s a shame because usually there’s some good thinking there. Using tools like Pattern Lab’s annotations feature or Elliance’s Metaframe allow annotations to make into the browser as well. Done right, these annotations can remain intact in a living style guide/pattern library.
They lay the foundation for the final product – At the beginning of my projects I set up Pattern Lab so that I can start establishing my interface system and get a head start on my final code. While doing my wireframes, I have a bunch of stuff that looks like <div class="fpo">Pagination</div>, but in wiring up these placeholders, I’m simultaneously laying the foundation for my design system which will ultimately become the final code.
They allow you to iterate – Swapping things around in code is often much more efficient than having to adjust a bunch of layouts in a static design tool. Wireframing in code gives you the chance to take your initial sketches and iterate on them until they become the final product.
From Wireframe to Final Product

In a traditional waterfall process there’s a clean line between the wireframing phase and the visual and code phases. Developing wireframes in the browser blurs that line, which is nothing but a good thing. Instead of shuffling around wireframes_02112014_v2_FINAL_forreview_final_FINAL_jonedits.pdf, you’re able to spend more time in the browser building up the fidelity of the final product.

The initial wireframes utilized the gray box technique in a single column layout. As mentioned above, this helps us get at what content needs to be on the page and in what general order. I also typically get a head start on the header and footer so that the thing somewhat resembles a website.

Next up is introducing a general layout into the gray block wireframes. This helps articulate what happens on larger screens when there’s enough room for sidebars, section navigation, etc.

Once we feel good about the content on the page, I start replacing the gray boxes with molecules and organisms that will eventually become part the final interface. In the above example, I’m replacing the “Other programs” block with a pattern called “section navigation”. That include looks like this:

Eventually all the gray boxes are replaced with pattern includes. At this stage things are still extremely foundational so things still look like garbage. But we’ll get to that later.

At this stage most of the design patterns are wired up and the structure is sound. This gives us the opportunity to go in and start styling some of the more global organisms like the global header and footer. The style of these elements will no doubt be tweaked throughout the process, but the initial styles give us a stylistic foundation.

Once the global elements are styled, we start tackling the inner guts of the interface. We’ll obviously spend a lot of time doing this, and for the food bank project we’ve only just begun. But along with the rest of our timeline, it’s fun to see progress being made.

I’ve been working this way for the last year and a half, and it’s great to see other folks like Matt Griffin and the smart folks at Bearded follow a similar process. As I mentioned in my post about our TechCrunch redesign, I think of this process as being similar to subtractive sculpture.

You start out with a big slab of rock, and slowly chip away to get the rough shape of the form you’re creating. You take another pass at it to get a better sense of the object you’re trying to extract from the stone. You take another pass to start getting a bit more detailed. Eventually, you start honing in on a particular aspect of the form: a face, the arms, or the torso. Slowly but surely you detail each section of the sculpture until you’ve arrived at the final form.
Designing for a multitude of screen sizes, environments, and variables is hard work, so getting into the browser as quickly as possible gives us an opportunity to design and develop more realistic solutions.

There’s a conversation that crops up time to time again about the definition of responsive design and treating RWD as a goal unto itself. Has it evolved beyond Ethan Marcotte’s original definition? There are so many articles out there on the subject already, but since it keeps coming up I figure it’s still worth talking about.

Of course there’s a whole lot more to creating a great multi-device than fluid grids, flexible media, and media queries. The core tenets of responsive design are obviously important, and over the last few years they’ve helped the Web community better cope with the never-ending flood of Web-enabled devices. But those three ingredients are just the tip of the iceberg.

iceberg

So what beyond fluid grids, flexible media, and media queries do we need to concern ourselves with when crafting multi-device Web experiences? In asking myself that question (some time ago now), I landed on five guiding principles of adaptive design:

Ubiquity
Flexibility
Performance
Enhancement
Future-Friendly
Ubiquity

The power of the Web is its ubiquity, and it’s our responsibility as web designers to do our best to preserve the Web’s biggest feature.

Achieve content parity across devices, and avoid the myth of the mobile context.
Understand the difference between “support” and “optimization”.
Be considerate and inclusive as much as humanly possible.
Flexibility

There ain’t no going back to the fixed-width days of yore. In order to create effective designs for our multi-device age, we must embrace the Web’s intrinsic fluidity.

Create device-agnostic interfaces that aim to look and function beautifully everywhere on the resolution spectrum.
Let content determine breakpoints instead of using today’s popular device dimensions.
Don’t just create myopic buckets (“phone”, “tablet”, and “desktop”). Rather consider the entire resolution spectrum and all the devices–both present and future–that will access your experience.
Use tools that encourage flexibility
Performance

The first few years of our responsive age were spent getting our heads around the mechanics of media queries and other techniques. All the while the size of average Web page–responsive or not–skyrocketed in size. So it’s been a welcome change to see more folks care about performance and tackle the performance-related issues of the multi-device Web.

Treat performance as design and help your organization prioritize performance.
Set performance budgets and stick to them.
Embrace conditional loading, as this crucial technique helps us deliver highly-performant and fully-featured experiences to our users.
Get into the browser sooner and test early and often. Performance is invisible, so testing is essential to help us catch performance-hurting decisions.
Enhancement

Responsive web design does not need to stop at making squishy layouts. This isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. Responsive design is very much an extension of progressive enhancement, so don’t get hung up thinking that media queries are the only tool in your toolbox.

Recognize that the Web is a continuum, not a platform.
Use feature detection to capitalize on device/browser capabilities so that we can support more devices while still optimizing for the the best of the best
Recognize that many interface patterns (From social widgets to images to maps to lightboxes) require more than simple translation in order to work well across all screens.
Read Adaptive Web Design by Aaron Gustafson and apply those principles and techniques in your work.
Future Friendly

No one knows what the Web and device landscape is going to look like in a couple years, but there’s a damn good chance the gadgets sitting underneath Christmas trees a few years from now will have access to the Web.

The key aspect of future-friendly thinking is to acknowledge and embrace unpredictability.
Think in a future-friendly way by focusing on what really matters, creating portable data, and getting your content ready to go anywhere.
Be present friendly. As Josh Clark says, “When it comes to the Web, the more backward-compatible you are, the more forward-compatible you’re likely to be.”
Guiding Principles

I like these principles. For me, they serve as a sort of checklist for any strategic, design, or development decision. If decisions go against one or more of these principles, we need to have a conversation.

Ember 2

Techniques come and go quickly in this crazy-fast-paced-and-volatile industry. I’d recommend not getting too hung up on definitions, mechanics, and techniques. Instead, establish some guiding principles that can help ground you and help you make better decisions.

Jason Frasier, design director at DesignMap, stopped by Tradecraft last week to share his perspectives on prototyping, how it is replacing documentation as a UX deliverable, and how we can utilize prototyping in our design process. Here are some of my learnings—

Final Documentation ≠ Final Product

Working at a design consultancy, documentation is often the primary deliverable to hand off to clients. When dealing with complex interactions, it’s not uncommon for documents to be over 100 pages long. Drafting these types of deliverables takes serious care, attention to detail, and significant time working at high fidelity in programs like Illustrator and Photoshop.

The big concern is that when designers ship their work to clients, the final documentation doesn’t become the final product regardless of how well it’s crafted.

“Documentation could be overlooked, ignored, or simply out of date by the time it comes to actually implement a feature if we’re working with a very agile development team.”
In addition, documentation is inflexible. Often, the effort involved keeping things consistent when changes are made can be more challenging than creating the design itself. In all, documentation can’t always able to meet the evolving needs of a client when they prepare to ship their product and that is problematic.

Prototypes are Powerful

People don’t read products — they interact with them.
Creating a prototype as a final deliverable allows for greater interaction with the product and a deeper-level understanding of how the product is experienced. It can also easily be adopted for usability testing and iterated on quickly and efficiently to push out new versions.

Prototyping is also an impactful way to present to your client. People know how to interact with products. Demonstrating interactions with a prototype helps to spark well-informed discussions with clients and can lead to better design more quickly.

When discussing prototyping, it’s important to understand the methods and know when to use them. Jason went over five prototyping techniques that he thought were important to utilize at different parts of the design process.

How to Utilize Prototypes

— as you move through the design process.

Paper Prototype
Creating rough, hand-drawn sketches of UIs to put in front of users for testing.
When to Use: When you want to validate basic design ideas and understand rough interactions before going forward at a higher fidelity.
Presentation: Paper cutouts
Vision Prototype
Creating a presentation that quickly runs through an interaction at high fidelity.
When to use: When you want to wow your client. When it’s more about the polish than the actual experience. If you need to sell an idea.
Presentation: Keynote
Click-Through Prototype
Creating a set of static wireframe slides and discussing slide interactions.
When to use: When working with developers and project managers to demonstrate a linear flow through an experience quickly and efficiently.
Presentation: PDF
Wireframe Prototype
Creating a clickable wireframe prototype that can be put in front of users.
When to use: When conducting user testing or demonstrating interactions to clients at a higher fidelity.
Presentation: inVision
High Fidelity Prototype
Creating a prototype that closely resembles the real product.
When to use: When your product is nearly ready to ship.
Presentation: Web browser, mobile device, etc.
Conclusions

If you’re a UX designer, knowing how and when to prototype is already a requisite skill. Now, teams are transitioning from documentation to prototypes as final deliverables. Prototyping can make your design process more agile, allow you to express complex interactions elegantly, and present your work to your client in a more dynamic and iterative way. Avoid 100+ page documents and start prototyping.

Design Principle One:
When in doubt — reduce
Prior to 2013, busuu had been around for 5 years, had employed 4 different design agencies, had over 30 million users, and had never employed a single in-house designer. To say that it was a mess is an understatement. Our CEO Bernhard Niesner can often be found quoting that the majority of the website was designed by him on PowerPoint; this is not a joke.

Initially we dealt with this by identifying busuu’s key activity areas and (from a design perspective) we tried to reduce them down as much as possible; massively limiting the colour palette, font faces, and moving towards a flatter, cleaner, more usable design. This re-skinning of key pages continued until we came up with an overall design aesthetic that we felt suited the busuu product.


Our UI toolkit for Learning Components
Tip: Make (and use) a style guide even if you don’t know what your style is yet.
One of the key learnings for me was that we should have pushed for a style guide from day one. When you are in a big rush to get stuff done it is sometimes hard to prioritise work that will take time, but also save you time in the future. Style guides save time; they allow your developers to re-use their CSS, they force the whole website to be consistent without you spending hours doing design QA, and allow you to make design changes to the live site quickly, dynamically and with less risk of annoying your developers.


The original busuu blue: #3190d0
Believe me, it was difficult to explain why #3190d0 really, really needed to change to #61bcf9…


The current busuu blue: #61bcf9
…and seeing these colours together here it is amazing to think about how much of change it made, however our switch to a lighter, brighter colour palette was actually one of the most successful design changes that we did in the last year; increasing conversion and massively improving busuu´s appearance of being fun and accessible.

Design Principle Two:
Pictures are better than words (and icons are better than pictures)
Busuu teaches people to learn foreign languages — and it’s good at it; since I have been working here our user base has grown by just over 10 million.

As a result of having such a large user base, we have to cater for multiple interface languages with dramatically varying text lengths. See below for an example of why this is difficult:


An example of the same text in both English and Russian
To get around this text-length problem we have made a huge effort to use icons as much as possible to support and (where possible) to replace text translations. This is most noticeable with our learning activities; which we have changed from photos to consistent, recognisable icons.

Tip: Use SVGs
Again — it seems easier to just do a sprite sheet for web, but having SVGs will save you heaps of time in the long run if you are redesigning your product and are susceptible to decisions changing around colour, size, etc. Following Joe Harrison’s excellent example, we are experimenting at the moment with having embedded icon variations for smaller views, and are even looking at changing our icons depending on our user’s locale and age, etc using SVG layering.

Design Principle Three:
Less steps good, more steps bad
Our users come to busuu to learn languages — so we have reduced the number of steps required before they can access a learning unit. This has meant removing our activity menu screen (which saw an immediate 27% rise in learning unit completion rates). We know that some of our users are more interested in certain learning activities than others (for instance, speaking not writing, and vice versa). We have therefore split our learning units up into smaller sections that are accessible right away from your dashboard.


This is one of our lesson cards, which appear on the dashboard — the first page the user sees on the web application
Another thing we know is that our users who have friends to compete with are more active (and more active means you learn better). As result we have added a leader board that allows our users to immediately see how well they are progressing against their friends.

As well as this we have reduced the amount of forms we require users to fill in (in general, but mainly as part of the sign up process). This has been successful; our recent redesign of the sign up flow resulted in a 70% increase in sign ups. I cannot tell you how good it feels as a designer to see analytics like that.

Tip: Don’t get lost in product re-skins
The busuu product is huge; a re-skin of the whole thing was never going to be an easy or a fast task. Break it into parts, and don’t ignore obvious navigation, user flow and UX issues in favour of a re-skin unless you are going to be able to complete that re-skin VERY quickly; otherwise you’ll end up re-building bad designs with a new colour scheme, and not be able to go back and iterate on them until months after.

Design (Team) Principle Four:
Work fast
Like a lot of (design) teams, for a long time now we have suffered from a condition known as ‘too-many-projects-and-not-enough-time’. Just over a month ago our brilliant head designer Aftab Arab moved on and we didn’t have a replacement. In Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson’s excellent book Rework they recommend not re-hiring straight away so that you can test how you function minus one person. For us, this experience enabled us to use our limited resources as a reason to better prioritise work, and to say no to design requests that weren’t vital. This is important; startups need to work faster than other companies. This isn’t accomplished in a literal sense (although on another note, always use the correct tools for the job). Working faster is accomplished by working smarter; weeding out tasks that don’t need to be there, prioritising work correctly, staying focussed on the overall goals and key product needs, and, sometimes, by saying no.

Conclusion:
Redesign your culture, not just your product
We think busuu will be around for a long time — and as a result I don’t like referring to the redesign project, as a project. A project suggests that it is something that will be finished; a design culture is something that will be constantly improved, added to and iterated on.

With this in mind, we have just completed constructing a dynamic style guide for design, branding, and copy. We are improving the tools we use to make us faster and better; Sketch for wire-framing, SVG icons and designs, Flinto and proto.io for prototyping, Photoshop and Illustrator for high-resolution design concepts. The best advice I can give you though, is to collaborate. Listen to your team, work with your colleagues, share ideas, swap seats with each-other, take pride in your collective work — build next level shit, and celebrate when you have achieved something good, even if there’s still a million other things you want to do (there always will be).

As mobile designers, we have a stark decision to make: do we spend time learning new tools and changing our design processes to create our own transitional interfaces, or are the tools that we’ve been using good enough?
There’s an old writing adage that advises writers, whenever possible, to “show, don’t tell” when bringing characters to life. The goal is to reveal the story through the character’s experiences instead of the author’s.
When designing mobile products, we share a similar burden. Dammed up inside our heads are creative waterfalls of fresh interactions, transitions, and animations. But how are we supposed to communicate them to our teams, our developers? How do we get them out of our heads? Through a game of charades?
I’m guilty of that last one.
Not being able to “show” — in an efficient way — the interactions and animations that bring our designs to life is one of the common struggles plaguing our industry. The static mockups favored in our past are no longer good enough. They simply don’t do the job. Even relative newcomer Sketch — for all of its strength over Photoshop, the Goliath — can only create static screens that must be strung together, struggling to tell our product’s stories.
Exacerbating the urgency of this challenge is the simple fact that we now design for screens that can be tapped, pinched, swiped, zoomed, and more. There’s no way around the fact that our interfaces must become transitional, alive, and reactive to fingers. The mouse is becoming a relic of the past.
For the first time ever, a generation of people starting as babies are using the touch-based apps we create.

Ways you can incorporate this skill into your design workflow
Mobile Designers Are Hungry For A Better Way
Over the past year, there’s been a growing hunger in the design community to find a better way to “show” design interactions instead of “telling” them. Furthering this trend are large organizations like Airbnb, Evernote, Facebook, Google, and HubSpot. Many of them have been surprisingly benevolent by showing how they’ve started to include prototyping in their product workflows and the practical results of doing so.
The most organized, highest-profile effort in these endeavors has been Facebook’s, through its open-sourcing of Origami. A set of tools and extensions built on top of Apple’s Quartz Composer (QC), these are the same tools used by the Facebook Creative Labs team that created Paper, Home, Slingshot, and more. Even renowned design firm IDEO released its own tools for QC called Avocado.

It’s also been a poorly kept secret for some time now that Apple has a set of its own advanced prototyping tools. Rumored to be called “Mica,” it’s a tool Apple created for its UI designers to craft interactive interfaces more easily. Mica is allegedly Quartz Composer’s internal replacement, and has been used to create everything from interfaces to Final Cut Pro plugins. I wouldn’t be surprised if Mica had a role to play in the creation of iOS 7 and 8.
That’s Nice, But What About My Problems?
You might be thinking that prototyping is just some corporate fad — like something akin to transparent glass whiteboards or Six Sigma. Or it’s something that only elitist organizations with lots of time and money can afford to do.
But here’s the simple truth: prototyping can help all of us who are building mobile products create better products. And if that wasn’t enough, it’ll bring your team together and make your clients — or “stakeholders,” if you must use that word — happier, more in the loop, and more apt to buy into what you’re building.
Sounds like the Holy Grail to me.
OUR CAST OF CHARACTERS
It should be pointed out that I was, previously, a prototyping skeptic. I saw it as a frivolous luxury that took my time away from creating pixel-perfect, static mockups.
For years, my process was the same:
I’d create every possible state imaginable in pixel-perfection, and then spend countless words writing out how the app was supposed to work in a narrative format.
Our team would then sit through countless debates about what each of us had envisioned as the “right” functionality.
After our debates, we’d finally sit down to building what we agreed on in our heads. I’d spend countless hours trying to explain what I actually envisioned for the project’s interactions once we had something to work with.
This process worked for a time. We were building solely for the web with few responsive requirements. But the process became increasingly painful as we started to develop mobile apps. The cost and time required to backtrack after ideas didn’t pan out created unnecessary sink costs and mental overhead. Because we spent so much time building something, we felt compelled to use it.
We realized there had to be another way. And that’s when prototyping entered my world. I realized that my inability to move up the chain and contribute to creating the interactions I designed slowed us down. It hindered my team’s efforts to move quickly and to realize the success or failure of our product decisions faster.
So I set out both to learn how to prototype and learn where to incorporate it into my workflow. I also went into the field both to find and to learn from designers who are prototyping veterans: Steve Meszaros, product designer at Wildcard and Pauly Ting, user interface director at Tigerspike.
Meszaros works at Wildcard with Khoi Vinh, former design director at the New York Times and named by Fast Company one of the fifty most influential designers in America. With Vinh, Meszaros is responsible for the interface design and interactivity for the not-yet-launched startup, which aims to combine the performance and experience of native apps with the breadth of the entire internet.
Ting is head of user experience at Tigerspike, a design firm that builds apps and mobile sites for Fortune 500 clients, from big-box retailers to internet giants. His work must operate at a massive scale from day one to satisfy not only his clients, but his client’s bosses and his client’s customers.
The following is what I learned about prototyping, both from my own practice and from a number of in-depth interviews with both of them. I’ll explore the benefits of prototyping and how you can incorporate prototyping into your workflow, today.
Prototyping: Best Served With A Healthy Dose Of Focus
Rapid prototyping’s primary purpose is to focus your already limited time. You’re cutting out fluff, tangents, and feature-creep to bring to life a very specific use case or workflow. Your job is to identify that:
You’re building the right thing.
This piece of your product solves the right problem.
This interaction is something your team is capable of building within a reasonable timeframe.
The first goal of prototyping is to test, prove, or conceptualize an idea that’s in your head within a limited timeframe or budget.
“It’s much like a hackathon,” says Ting.
The entire purpose here is to get your ideas out of your head as quickly as possible, and at a fidelity that presents the concepts in your head clearly enough.
All the time and frustration you spend trying to communicate rough interactions can be cut out by simply showing what you mean. A prototype serves as the seed and showcase of your ideas.
Many designers who start prototyping begin by trying to do too much. But the entire purpose of prototyping isn’t to design the interactions of your entire product at once, or to just make pretty things. It’s to demonstrate bite-sized pieces of interaction or specific workflows.
Choose The Right Tool For The Job
That being said, a successful prototype speaks directly to its audience. That means that before you start, you need to understand:
Who’s involved in the design process.
Who needs to be able to use it and provide feedback.
How soon it must be delivered.
The complexity of the idea you need to communicate.
Depending on how these factors are configured, a prototype can take on different forms. You might, for example, be able to get away with an unpolished, ugly, hacked-up HTML and CSS combo. Or sketches and wireframes might do. But in some cases, you’ll need to create more polished, accessible prototypes to really understand if an interaction will work.
If you’re on a product team and developing or refining new features, your job is to determine the product and features your team needs to build. You need to understand, define and communicate this as quickly and as thoroughly as you can. The product you define and design must solve the right problem and be something your team is capable of building within a reasonable timeframe.
Start by understanding the purpose of the product you’re building. Never lose sight of that as you move through the process. You also need to be aware of the team involved (whether it’s yours or includes a client), the timeframe, and the required deliverables.
“A prototype can serve many purposes. It can be just for demonstrating an idea, it can be for exploring and testing an idea, it can be for selling an idea, or it can be to build an MVP,” says Ting.
If you need to prototype a user flow, make sure that it tells a story. This can be more powerful than simply prototyping a single interaction, since single interactions are best understood by dedicated product teams. They’ll better understand where in the flow the interaction sits, how it’s different than any existing interactions, and how it will make an improvement.
Consequently, prototyping a single flow helps anybody using the prototype become more emotionally connected to the product. It enables one to get lost in the experience and better illustrates any differences or improvements to old or competitive flows.
These factors determine the tools you should choose to build your prototype. Overall, you should stick to this rule of thumb: if most of the time you spend prototyping is using the tool itself versus on the thought behind the design, you may be using the wrong tool for the job.
PROTOTYPING TOOLS IN ACTION: AN EXAMPLE USING INVISION
Meszaros, Ting, and myself have Quartz Composer/Origami and Framer.js in our prototyping toolboxes. Lately, though, Ting has found that he throws down basic user flows first with InVision, then homes in on specific interactions when necessary.
“InVision is my first go-to prototyping tool, largely because it’s so fast and simple to set up, with the added benefit of being able to share it seamlessly,” says Ting. “It requires no technical knowledge, which means when working with non-technical stakeholders, there’s an easy and low barrier for them to collaborate, participate, and more constructively contribute to the design process. It’s easily the fastest tool to use to create a polished-feeling experience.”
InVision can help piece together a series of static mockups quickly, providing somebody without technical knowledge the feeling of actually moving between screens. It can immerse people inside or outside your organization in the product, quickly selling an idea with basic segues and transitions.
Here’s an example of an InVision prototype Ting used to win a hackathon put on by the rental car giant Hertz. Ting’s task was to come up with a product strategy for what a “connected car” experience could look like for Hertz customers. Within 24 hours, Ting’s team of three researched the use case, created user stories, and constructed the prototype.

With this prototype, Ting was able to tell a story about how a mobile app could improve the overall experience of renting a car. It included real-world experiences typically faced by rental car customers, and prototyped how push notifications, GPS navigation, and in-app commerce could be combined to create a compelling flow.

You can see how easy it is to get started with InVision by checking out this short video.
THE POWER OF ADVANCED PROTOTYPING TOOLS
Limited to basic transitions and animations, InVision trades personality for expediency. More advanced tools like Quartz Composer or Framer.js could unlock interactions you otherwise wouldn’t be able to represent with InVision. These tools, while sometimes difficult to adopt, are the key to creating wholly original interactions tailored to your product and visual style.
“Prototyping [with advanced tools] has taught me more about design and usability than I had imagined,” says Meszaros. “It’s a fun way to learn a new language or application and is critical to building and articulating interaction. I’d recommend taking an hour a day to play with a new prototyping application or language such as Framer.js. Download example files off GitHub and dissect them, tweak them, adjust them.”
Advanced prototyping tools like Quartz Composer are almost a requirement for you to create interactions and animations that have never before been seen. And they’re a must if you need fine-grained control over every aspect of your creation.
In my own experience, getting through the initial learning curve of Quartz Composer and Origami wasn’t the epic struggle it’s been advertised to be. After only a few hours, I was able to create complete flows with wholly original interactions and present them to my team for testing, feedback, a few iterations, and implementation in Xcode. It was both creatively satisfying and expedient, as it saved my team countless hours of vague back-and-forth to get interactions and animation timing exactly right.
To neutralize this perceived learning curve, I co-created a video crash course that specifically helps mobile designers master the basics of Quartz Composer and Origami in five days or less. You can start creating prototypes right away at your own pace. Jay Thrash also has a great series of videos for Quartz Composer beginners, and I’ve also enjoyed the work of the Pra Brothers.
Test Your Prototype As Soon As Possible
Once the prototype is ready for consumption, it should immediately be used to drive discussion toward the eventual decision about how to proceed.
Beyond speed, this is another huge benefit of prototyping. It allows for greater buy-in across your organization and even among your clients. The prototype becomes a common language that can be experienced and understood by everyone.
It’s here that your goal is to understand where your interaction or flow falls short. What parts are implausible to build or too over-the-top? Where do people get confused? What parts could use more personality or ingenuity? How could these changes inform other parts of your product? Get it in front of your developers, decision makers, customers and clients and you’ll have quick answers to these questions.
“Visualizing [and experiencing] interactions allows us to have more constructive conversations with the larger team,” says Meszaros. “Prototypes have been instrumental in bringing together and facilitating feedback across all areas of the team from strategy, to engineering and design. By developing prototypes, we have greater control of our consequences. At Wildcard, discovering whether or not a build may be expensive is critical to staying on target,” he continues. “That’s why I strongly advocate designing and prototyping in context whenever possible. I find it best to build with all attributes of the UI in place as it would be in the final product.”
PROTOTYPING IN ACTION: A EXAMPLE FROM WILDCARD
To illustrate this, let’s look at a prototype Meszaros built for Wildcard using Quartz Composer and Origami. This also happens to be the first time the company has released anything to the public about how the Wildcard product looks and works.
“This is an early example of what we built with Quartz Composer and Origami while defining our interaction paradigms,” says Meszaros. “The prototype highlights a key problem: notice that the old ‘cards’ transition by falling off of the screen, while new cards ‘spawn’ from beneath the parent card.”
One of many prototypes built by Stephen Meszaros to fine-tune how old content is dismissed and new content loaded in Wildcard.

“It quickly became apparent [in user testing] that this may confuse someone as to the location of the old cards. Some questions we asked ourselves were ‘where do I find my old cards?’ ‘Are they lower on the screen?’ and the like. With this, we were able to identify some key concerns in developing this prototype and quickly built alternative prototypes with more confidence.”
This confusion was uncovered in one of Wildcard’s prototype review sessions, led by Meszaros and Vinh.
This small example highlights the importance of taking the time to perform unbiased user tests with the prototypes you’ve built. It’s not enough to create a prototype and informally perform over-the-shoulder review sessions. Prototypes require dedicated segments of time with potential customers, your clients, and team members to see how they respond.
After each session is over, take notes about how you can improve the prototype while it’s fresh in your mind. Sometimes, the problems identified in a prototype can even be remedied within minutes or seconds by making on-the-fly changes. The effect of this speed is immeasurable, because it affects so many areas of the organization — it increases the creativity and originality of a designer, it prevents code from being wasted (and, subsequently, keeps the code base cleaner), it unifies the team, and it brings the product closer to what your customers actually want.
A TYPICAL TIMEFRAME
So how long should the typical prototyping cycle take? On average, the three of us found that the entire loop of prototype creation, testing, iteration, and readying for implementation took about a week. The most each of us had seen was two weeks — mostly due to communication lulls.
One to two weeks allows enough time to come up with ideas and deliver them without fluff, tangents, or politics. It’s a forcing function to prevent wasted cycles. But it’s long enough to stop, breathe, and be able to make smart decisions.
But it’s important to note that there’s no defined scale for this time period. That’s to say, we’ve each been able to prototype everything from a very specific effect (i.e. the effect a user sees when a camera takes a photo), a user flow (how a user sends another user a photo), to the basics of how an entire app works. The scope depends on the level of polish you need, what phase of development you’re in, and who the audience is. Remember, though, that the longer the “sprint,” the more difficult it becomes to maintain momentum.
For many small product teams, the typical turnaround of this process could be as fast as a a typical business day.
“The biggest thing I’ve learned about rapid prototyping is that it’s a great equalizer,” said Ting. “Using tools like InVision or Quartz Composer really puts the onus on UI, UX, PMs, and engineers to understand each other’s disciplines and thus work together. We’ve had little conflict, everyone feels informed and it’s very organic in feeling. Rapid prototyping allows that. It’s not just a tool or even a methodology, it’s a culture.”
Ensuring A Repeatable Process
Once the prototype has been vetted by your team and, ideally, your customers or clients, it’s your job to make it easy for an engineer to implement.
Depending on your tools of choice, this can take many forms. For some, it might be just handing off code you wrote in Framer.js, or sharing your Xcode Storyboards. It doesn’t matter if your code is messy — it only matters that your developers know the experience you’re trying to achieve, the logic required to get there, and specific values for timing, speed, bounciness, tap areas, and other particulars.
If you used Quartz Composer and Origami, share your composition files and extract key values, such as transition and animation timing. Include the type of easing curve, such as “Quadratic In-Out,” if applicable. Providing as much information up front about how to implement your ideas will increase the speed at which you can ship your product.
Bleed as much into the development process as you can, and hone this skill over time. The amount of effort and care you invest in this handoff phase will have a direct effect on your organizaton’s process. Since it makes it easier on your engineering team to implement your ideas, it’ll help to solidify prototyping as a staple of your development efforts.
Weaving prototyping into your process may seem daunting if there are many separate teams handling pieces of the app’s design. You might, for example, have separate user interface and wireframing teams. Remember that for prototyping to be successful, it has to be an inclusive — and highly-collaborative — process. Wherever possible, separate teams need to work side-by-side to eliminate the rudimentary boundaries of departments and even physical space.
In the end, prototyping brings everybody who’s involved in the process of building a product closer to the end goal: making something that your customer wants. Embracing this means changing how your team works.
A CHALLENGE: APPROACH YOUR DESIGN GOALS FROM NOW ON WITH A PROTOTYPING MIND
In the end, you’ll be amazed at what you can accomplish through prototyping. Not only is it a great unifier for your team and your customers, it builds excitement for what you’re building and makes everyone feel like they’re a part of the design process. It brings joy and momentum to design reviews. And it helps your team make better decisions.
“Prototyping helps us to make more deliberate and calculated decisions as a group, and that is what may be most important aspect of prototyping,” says Meszaros. “It’s an engaging way to review new features or updates and brings a bit of joy to our design reviews. Don’t be intimidated to prototype, you’ll be amazed by what you can accomplish.”
But perhaps the most powerful side effect is that it can make you a better designer. You’ll become both more productive and more creative. When you’re building rapid prototypes, you begin to create feedback loops that improve your designs. You’ll stumble upon ideas as you work through the core problem you’re trying to solve.
“There are regular situations where I would literally change a design in front of everyone mid-discussion and ask, ‘is that what you mean?’” recalls Ting. “And then we’d test and discuss that. It saved hours and days of emails, meetings, side conversations, politics and debate.”
NEXT STEPS
Learn a prototyping tool, ideally one that you can use to create designs meant for touch manipulation, like Quartz Composer or Framer.js. You’ll be investing in your own future.
Spend time hanging out in communities — online or offline — where you can learn from others with more prototyping experience. Understand their common struggles, how they’ve tackled them, and learn how they stay fresh. QC Designers is one of my go-to communities for Quartz Composer questions.
Collect videos (I use Reflector) or animated GIFs of app interactions that you like. Replicate them with your new prototyping skills.
Set a date for when you want to start using interactive prototypes in your daily work. Present to key co-workers and let them manipulate your designs on their own. Smile when they have a look of amazement on their face.

http://smashinghub.com/10-best-websites-for-ux-research-case-studies-and-tests.htm


The Internet is changing, with responsive websites quickly adapting to any device and screen size to bring the user the most dynamic experience possible. From multinational corporations like Sony, Microsoft, and Nokia to global tech stars like Salesforce to online travel giants like Expedia, serious players are turning to responsive web design to march in step with the current trends in and reach an even wider audience of customers.

But making responsive websites has its downsides. The value the site provides to the user is more important than ever, and aesthetics often take a backseat while performance reigns supreme. The problem is that performance cannot be mocked up in Photoshop, and new methods to meet design challenges have to be adopted. So here are 10 problems with creating responsive design websites, along with 10 possible solutions.

1. A More Problematic Visual Stage
In the past, the client had to approve static images and screenshots before development could begin. Today, designing can be a more chaotic and fluid process of sketching and prototyping where the focus is on designing elements and how they will be rearranged, depending on different device dimensions and resolutions.

Fix: There are two approaches to responsive sketching. One approach is creating sketches for a desktop home page, as well as every other website page, and then adapting them for the most popular tablet and mobile screen sizes and dimensions. Another approach is using paper and communicating to the client to demonstrate design layouts and how they will reflow on different screen sizes. Designing in the browser and working with HTML and CSS prototypes starts early on; creating a system of components and seeing how they can be reassembled for different configurations replaces the creation of wireframes for every single page and state. The chosen method is usually dictated by the complexity of the website.

2. Navigation
Before responsive design, every user knew where navigation was. Even though today, the three bars at the top left corner of the page usually represent the de facto navigation "button," many users still find it difficult to navigate beyond the menu, especially when it comes to websites with complicated structure. Today, the whole concept of navigation has to be reconsidered.

Fix: Designers should spend more time trying to make navigation intuitive and self-explanatory. Studying the website’s content and information architecture, and understanding users—how and why they browse the site—is the only way to make a unique navigation decision. In addition, testing navigation on as many products as possible can help developers get it right.

3. The Appearance of Background Images and Icons
Images are crucial to a user’s experience on the web. In responsive design, images and icons have to be flexible to allow users to enjoy the graphics on high pixel density devices, which are becoming more widespread. Making sure the images don’t look blurry and poorly scaled up is the goal of every designer and developer.

Fix: Lazy loading images can help optimize browser rendering and reduce the number of HTTP round trips by deferring the loading of images that are not in the client's view. Making icons scalable (using the SVG format, which keeps icons light yet high-quality) and retina-ready can also help users enjoy the website without loss of quality on any device.

4. Showing Data on Small Screens
Showing data tables (airline flight timetables, for instance) on small screens is a real problem when the tables are complex and convoluted. It doesn’t help that they are also often large with a great number of rows and columns.

Fix: Responsive tables are the best bet right now. There are also other methods: abandoning the grid layout and creating a smaller table that doesn’t call for horizontal scrolling; building more compact pie charts out of tables; replacing tables with smaller versions while offering a link to the full version; hiding unimportant elements on small screens with a dropdown menu with access to the full table; rainbow tables where colors are used instead of columns; and even flipping the table on its side to make it fit.

5. Creating Rich Experiences that Load Fast
One of the biggest challenges is finding the balance between a rich user experience and the fast-paced nature of the Internet. Responsive websites sometimes weigh a lot, and because they attract traffic from both desktops and mobile devices, the experience can suffer from slow loading times. This means losing business, as the majority of mobile users leave after five seconds of not getting what they expect.

Responsive websites sometimes weigh a lot and the experience can suffer from slow loading timestweet this

Fix: The solution is conditional loading, which allows for loading of only what users need, when they need it. The rule of thumb is this: first load content, then enhancements, then leftovers. With users so used to lots of images, galleries, documents, downloads, etc. on awebsite, with the mobile-first approach, designers should take care to keep only the elements that are absolutely necessary to convey the message of the website. Because the proliferation of mobile devices is outpacing desktops, conditional loading is the way to go. And since in conditional loading many automation tools for scaling and caching images are used, it makes future changes to the site easier and faster. Also, assuming that the user connection is not perfect is a must to provide high performance.

6. Longer Designing, Developing, and Testing Periods
Because responsive websites have to work amazingly well on multiple (very different) devices—all while boasting rich functionality and complicated design elements—they often take longer to design, develop, and test. Usually it takes about twice as long to design a responsive site compared to a regular site.

Fix: The problem already contains a solution. Even though responsive sites may take longer to create, they are also better candidates for gradual change and natural evolution. Instead of having to implement major overhauls to a website, which are costly and lengthy, responsive sites can evolve step-by-step, saving owners a lot of time and effort in the long run.

7. Hiding and Removing Content
Websites with complicated UI elements, advanced search features, multi-step forms, data tables, calculators, dashboards with third-party scripts, and so on often pose a problem because they simply contain too much information. The approach so far has been to hide or remove content from users, but many people feel they deserve access to all information, even if they are browsing on a small device. In some cases, there is no way for a user to get the full version of the website they are browsing.

Fix: Thorough planning from the onset that determines where content is arranged in a way that doesn’t force developers to hide anything is the solution. The goal should be to optimize as much as possible, remove unnecessary elements from early drafts and focus on the core structure of the website, without adding any bells and whistles. Now is not the time to embellish, but to prioritize and cut. It is always best to give the user the possibility to have access to the full version of the website, if they choose to do so.

8. Converting Fixed Sites Into Responsive Ones
This is a huge dilemma: is it necessary to change the less flexible code of fixed-layout websites or can they be left as they are and still provide acceptable performance?

Fix: The conversion process is a challenging, but for light and simple websites, it’s feasible and has been done successfully in the past. The choice is often to reverse style sheets and templates or start a greenfield rebuild, which is a process of rebuilding the site without the need to consider any prior work. When you have a bigger, complicated website, a greenfield rebuild is a better option than not doing a conversion at all.

9. Older Versions of Internet Explorer Don’t Support CSS3 Media Queries
When working with mobile-first techniques, your website might not display properly on older versions of IE. In these cases, developers should find a way to support an older website on mobile devices.

Fix: It is best to take care of Internet Explorer users and to offer them a handy solution. An experienced designer can easily change page layouts, depending on the size of the browser window, using JavaScript. With a goal of maintaining the original layout, the solution is to use polyfill, which is a portion of code that provides the technology that developers expect the browser to provide natively. Another fix may be to use a conditional IE style sheet with elementary styling or do nothing at all if it looks passable. It all depends on the needs of the end user.

10. Not Everyone Understands Why They Should Go Responsive
The process of working with clients is not always structured and orderly, and the methodologies for responsive design are still being refined and tested. Solutions to challenges are rarely set in stone, which sometimes creates uncertainty and confusion for clients.

Fix: Showing the benefits of responsive design in action is the best way to get positive feedback and approval. Responsive design can prove itself a significant advantage in the market in terms of multi-device functionality, making future fixes easy, and appealing to a much widest audience of users.

Conclusion
Even though responsive design is becoming more popular, there are still many questions left unanswered and no official solutions to the challenges that this trend poses. The most important thing to remember is that responsive design should improve experiences, not reduce opportunities for users, and all designer and developer efforts should be aimed at making that goal a reality.





03. The automation of coding

There was a time when being able to code good quality HTML and CSS was enough. That is no longer the case. Not only is there a surplus of people able to do this, the need to code is waning.

Tools like Macaw and Adobe Reflow are enabling designers to do much of the work of front-end coders. Now I know what you are thinking — these tools create terrible CSS. You are right, but they are a sign of things to come. Over time these tools will become more sophisticated. It wouldn't surprise me if eventually hand coding HTML and CSS becomes a skill few still need.

Although these tools will never produce code as good as a person, it will be good enough. In the end it will come down to return on investment. For many 'quick to market code' that is 'good enough' will be a better investment than hand-coded.

Web design trends for 2015
Tools like Macaw are a sign of things to come
But even if that does not happen, these tools are already having an impact. Creating working prototypes has become much easier. A job that used to keep a front end coder busy for days if not weeks.

It's easy to dismiss the impact of these tools. They don't replace a good coder. But, I remember graphic designers saying the same thing about desktop publishing. DTP didn't replace the graphic designer but it did thin the herd.

If you are a designer, you might be feeling a little smug at this point. After all we will always need people to design websites no matter how we code our sites. But perhaps longer term even that will change.

http://blog.invisionapp.com/embrace-inconsistency/

Consistency is a powerful thing. As humans we subconsciously expect harmony and order in our everyday interactions. There’s a reason every stop sign around the world looks pretty much the same. When I visited Australia, learning to drive on the other side of the street was hard enough. Imagine if every city had its own custom stop sign—neon purple stop signs—what! In a way, we depend on consistency to make us feel normal and comfortable.

We take notice when things are inconsistent. It can be frustrating and confusing. But sometimes it can be refreshing and engaging. I love Starbucks. I can robotically go through the motions of ordering my coffee, and I don’t flinch when I’m handed my venti white cup. Then all of a sudden it’s November, and I’m handed an enchanting red holiday cup with a wintery mix of graphical coziness. Nothing against the classic white cups that Starbucks uses year-round, but sometimes mixing it up is good. It captivates and engages customers in ways they’re not used to.

All of this carries over to our relationships with technology. As designers we should embrace the power of consistency. There are great benefits to knowing when to follow style guidelines diligently and realizing when to creatively break the rules.

We take notice when things are inconsistent. It can be frustrating and confusing. But sometimes it can be refreshing and engaging.

Building consistency

Design is hard, especially around the beginning of a project. So many ideas, so many typeface combos, color schemes, icon and button styles, layout trends, and photo treatments to sift through. Ideally all of these elements work together to communicate a clear message to your audience, but using them appropriately in relation to each other can get tricky.

Although it may be obvious, lets do a quick Consistency 101 review. Some elements we want to keep in mind in order to create consistency:

Color: primary, secondary, tert. color scheme
Typography: headline, body, script fonts and the hierarchy, positioning between them.
Visuals: icon sets, buttons, photo treatment, and illustrations.
Layout: nav/menu positioning, grid structure, and responsive flow
Interactions: form elements, dialogs, animations, transitions, menus, etc.
Here’s a couple examples of well-executed pattern libraries and style guides:

Salesforce pattern Library Mailchimp pattern Library
Building consistency into your designs helps strengthen your brand and keep the brand message clear. Defining consistent relationships between color, photography, typography, illustration, icons, etc., dictates how a user associates with your brand, how they feel about it and how they use it.

Once these frameworks and patterns are developed and established, designing with consistency in mind should be quite simple. And this makes our audience happy. A consistent interface requires less learning because users can carry over their knowledge from one page to the next, making the whole experience more fluid. This ease of understanding develops trust and comfort, which will keep the audience more engaged (read: convert to a customer).

Building consistency into your designs helps strengthen your brand and keep the brand message clear.

Don’t forget about the user

There have been arguments against consistency in design. One being that too many designers are focusing on whether or not their new designs are consistent with their outdated ones, rather than focusing on ensuring their new designs are in line with their target users current knowledge (Spool, 2005).

Does every primary button need to be blue? Do you need a search bar on every page? Does the footer need to be identical everywhere? Does the body font size always have to be 14px? It depends on what the situation is. User context should most often trump consistency.

The style guides and pattern libraries we build should not be used all the time without question. There are interface design principles other than consistency, and sometimes these principles should trump those of uniformity. The bottom line is: We should strive to deliver the optimal experience for our users, and sometimes that means sacrificing consistency for something else.

It’s less about “is what I’m designing consistent with the other things we’ve designed?” and more about “will what I’m designing match the users expectations that we’ve already set forth?”. Consistent design allows a user to be confident—they can expect it to behave like something they’ve encountered before.

There are interface design principles other than consistency, and sometimes these principles should trump those of uniformity.

Break the rules

There is an evil force out there that fights against consistency, and that is the natural impulse of designers to be creative. We want to express our creativity all of the time, and working within the confines of an established style guide or pattern framework can be downright frustrating. Don’t worry, we can use this to our advantage.

Before we go and make our entire interface cookie-cutter uniform, let's keep in mind that utilizing inconsistency has value. Inconsistent elements or behaviors spark attention—which can be a good thing when you want specific items or elements to be noticed. Using a new color or erratic layout can smack a user out of the habits of their subconscious. I like to call these strategic inconsistencies.

Using inconsistent elements can be most effective on the sales side of a platform or in areas where one’s looking to convert customers. Some easy things we can do to mix up the experience:

Adding new illustrative elements
Varying layout and hero section
Drastically changing headline font size
Introducing new photo treatments
Go crazy with color
Classy signup page
At Classy our signup and login pages look entirely different from the layout and styles established on our homepage, tour, and company pages. On these pages we can assume the user’s intention and don’t want to clutter the interface with unnecessary elements. It would be foolish to include a full top navigation, search, and footer just to maintain consistency between other pages.

Some other strategic inconsistencies around the web:

campaign monitor animation inconsistency
For Campaign Monitor, only the Customers page uses animation in the hero area of the page.

mailchimp snap interaction inconsistency
The interactions and animations on Mailchimp’s SNAP app page differ from the rest of its product tour.

Final thoughts

Great designers use consistency intelligently. Most often designers must strive for coherence and uniformity to leverage the most usable interface possible. However, the rules of consistency should not be followed blindly. A skilled designer will not only learn to follow these principles, but test them thoroughly and learn when to violate them in a purpose-driven and meaningful way.

Some thoughts on “designing in the browser”
December 23, 2014Babble, Creativity, CSS, Design
Ever since Andrew Clarke’s presentation The Walls Come Tumbling Down—which is the first time I heard of the term—the idea of “designing in the browser” has increasingly become a point of discussion and debate.

As one of those crazies who doesn’t use an image editor (like Photoshop) to create design comps, I’m often lumped into the design-in-the-browser category. So let’s clear things up a bit with my take on this approach.

You don’t actually design in the browser

Okay, you can design in the browser, meaning you open up a blank HTML file in both a text editor and a browser and have at it. But why would you? Some people really mean this when they speak of designing in the browser. But in my experience, that’s often not what we’re really talking about.

When I speak of designing in the browser, I mean creating browser-based design mockups/comps (I use the terms interchangeably), as opposed to static comps (like the PSDs we’re all used to). So it’s not the design. It’s the visualization of the design—the one you present to stakeholders. It’s not the only deliverable, but it’s the one that’s most important to show in the browser. Before that, I sketch. On paper. Other people I know who “design in the browser” actually use Photoshop. For sketching. But when we say “designing in the browser”, we mean the comp is in the browser.

We sure do like our comfort zones

Creating comps like this puts many designers out of their comfort zones. Many feel they have to learn to code, or “think in HTML and CSS”. Those who know that isn’t true can still feel awkward pairing up with a developer to visualize designs. That said, I think that learning CSS can be a useful addition to a designer’s toolbox. Note that in all my talks and in my book, I’ve only ever stated my opinion that browser-based comps are preferable to Photoshop-based comps. I have never stated that code should replace Photoshop.

That said, I’m increasingly frustrated by the articles, talks and discussions defending Photoshop comps, almost all of them citing Dan Mall’s idea of “deciding in the browser” rather than “designing in the browser”. I do agree with Dan; in fact, designers should already have been “deciding in the browser”, for years, especially when doing static image comps. If you design for the browser, you decide in the browser.

So much effort is being put into stating the case for static image comps, almost as if to justify the current (which is also the past) way of working. “Let me tell you why I want to stay in my comfort zone.” “Let me tell you what you other disciplines need to do for me so that I can continue to stay in my comfort zone and do things the way I’ve always done.”

It would all be fine, if it weren’t complete bullshit. And that is partly due to the flimsy premises of the arguments given.

Flimsy arguments

I don’t mean to pick on any specific article, but I’m compelled to provide an example and this particular article really got to me. Probably because I’m sure the author is skilled and talented, and thus many folks who read the article might swallow the premises whole. But looking at the points made, I’m inclined to disclose a couple of fallacies.

The author states that the desire to increase the speed of design and development is the driving force behind designing in the browser. While speed may be a factor, it’s arguably not the main factor, and certainly not the only one. More important, for example, is bridging the traditional gap between what the client sees in a comp versus the end result.
The implication of the sentence that follows is that web-based comps help speed but reduce the quality of the design work being produced. Tell that to The Guardian.
The author then proceeds to make the case for Photoshop instead of code (albeit with an 80/20 split). Nothing wrong with that, but the author’s personal experience with code yielding “dull” designs does not mean that code yields dull designs. It most likely means that the author tried getting into code too soon, or skipped sketching altogether, or is simply not as comfortable in code. I would agree that might not work out well. But in that case it’s the design process at fault, not the fact that code is used at all.
Code can support the creative process

Fabulous, creative things are being done with code. Just because some of us are more comfortable with graphical tools doesn’t negate that fact. It simply means that we’re less comfortable with code because we don’t know it as well as the tools we’ve been using for years and years. Which is logical, if you haven’t learned to code yet use Photoshop daily. And if you’re in my age range, you’ll remember that we didn’t always use Photoshop to create design comps. We had to get out of our comfort zone and learn it. And learn it we did, eventually.

For every person who tries opening a text editor and typing code from scratch before claiming “FAIL”, there are scores of us who actually sketch before even touching code. And I know designers who don’t code, but team up with developers to create design comps in the browser.

If you prefer using graphical tools, that’s fine. Nothing wrong with it. No one’s attacking you. But don’t say web-based comps are about speed when they’re not, that the process is less creative when your own approach to it is the problem. Photoshop is neutral. Code is neutral. It’s what you choose do with them and how.

I think code is a valuable tool, and I think web-based comps offer a plethora of benefits to the design process, clients, and teams. But again, I said web-based comps offer benefits as compared to Photoshop comps. Not “code is better than Photoshop”. That’s a huge difference. Designers know Photoshop; not all of them know the benefits of code as a design tool. I feel it’s important to talk about that.

Nobody is going to take your copy of Photoshop away from you. So since no one’s attacking, perhaps there’s no real need to defend. With false statements at that. In fact, for every defensive article or talk or tweet against code, I think about how time could have been spent learning some.

Creativity is tool-independent.

http://davidwalsh.name/images-improve-conversion-rate

Are you searching far and wide for a way to improve your new e-Commerce website conversion rate? Are you willing to try anything and everything, as long as it generates positive results? While many people focus on the most obvious points, such as the layout and content, there is a detail you may be overlooking: the use of images.

Advertisement
There are many benefits of using images, but only if you do this the right way. Your goals, as far as image use is concerned, should be two-fold:

To improve the overall look and feel of your website
To improve the conversion rate
Content may be king, but it can also be boring if that is all you see. When you add an image to a page, especially one that is attractive, reader engagement will improve, thus increasing the chance of a conversion.

Five Tips to Follow
At this point, you should have a basic understanding of why you should use images and what you are trying to accomplish. Now, let’s take a strong look at five tips for using images to improve conversion rate:

1. Play into Your Target Customer’s Emotions
For example, if you are selling a weight loss product, show before and after images of satisfied clients. This type of visual effect will get visitors excited. After all, they want to reach the same goal (losing weight) as those before them.

This may sound simple, and there is a reason for this: it is!

2. Unique is Always Better
Let’s face it: in today’s day and age, it is easy enough to search the internet for stock photos. It won’t take long to find a few that fit your website.

The problem with this is simple: stock photos look like stock photos. For this reason, your website may begin to feel “too commercial,” which can put people off.

This is particularly true as far as online stores are concerned. There is no better example of this than the Red Dress Boutique. Rather than using the same old boring images, time and time again, the company hires models to show off each and every piece in its store. This guarantees that each image is 100 percent unique.

3. Add Text to the Image
Sometimes, “a picture is worth a thousand words.” Other times, however, it is beneficial to add a caption. This can lead to a higher conversion rate for many reasons:

Attracts the visitor to the image
Keeps readers on the site longer (which is a key to a higher conversion rate)
Gives you another outlet for getting your point across
It doesn’t take much expertise to add text to images. There is software, as well as online programs, such as Spruce, that make this simple.

4. Experiment with Testimonials
Why do so many companies spend millions upon millions of dollars on commercials? Why do they spend a boatload on models and actors? Here’s the answer: people are always looking for another opinion. They want to be validated in some way, shape, or form.

If your website does not yet have pictures of happy customers, now is the time to add them. But don’t stop there. Make sure you throw in a testimonial as well. Add a few images with strong selling testimonials and there is a good chance your conversion rate will improve.

5. Test Each and Every Change
No matter how insignificant it may appear.

The four tips above are meant to point you in the right direction. When you implement one or more of these ideas, you are taking a step forward in increasing your conversion rate.

While the above tips have been proven successful, it doesn’t mean you should sit back and assume they are working.

Before you make a change, analyze your data to ensure you have a solid grasp on where things stand. After the change, continue to analyze your conversion rate for an extended period of time. Don’t jump the gun if you don’t experience great results right away. Give each change ample time to prove itself.

Note: don’t make more than one change at a time, as this makes it impossible to track the results.

Final Thoughts
It is easy to get so caught up in design and content related details that you overlook the impact of images on your conversion rate.

Don’t look at this as a tedious task. Look at it as a fun way of improving your site. Take cool pictures on your own. Learn how to create screenshots from videos. Once the results begin to roll in, you will realize just how important images are to your site’s conversion rate.

http://daverupert.com/2015/02/john-henry/

The Legend of John Henry is the tale of a steel drivin’ African American labor hero that defeated the Machine that came through town to take his job.

John Henry was a towering man, made of solid muscle, who earned his wages laying rail nearabout the mountains of West Virgina. He could hoist a jack, lay a track, he could pick and shovel, he could throw a hammer all day long.

One day a Steam Drill company rolled into town selling its wares and John Henry wanted to drive against it, he didn’t like machines taking people’s jobs. A contest was setup: Man vs. Machine. A grueling battle took place that day and according to the legend, which turns out to possibly be true, John Henry beat the Steam Drill that day.

But John Henry Didn’t Win
Many of the tales go on to tell what happened after his amazing victory. Thirsty and hungry, John Henry went home to his wife that night where she fed and tended his tired spirit. John Henry closed his eyes to rest but never woke.

John Henry bested the Machine, but it cost him everything. He’s a hero and patron saint for the working class. The songs like to say “the Hammer got the best of [him]”, something those of us on the edge of burnout understand. While inspiring, his victory is somewhat soured by his death and we in the 21st Century – having the gift of hindsight – now know the inevitable futility of that competition as very few railroads are laid by hand these days.

In the long run, the Machines did win.

So… Are Wordpress Themes, SquareSpace, Macaw, Froont, and The Grid killing web design? My new answer is: Probably. Probably a bit.

I used to vehemently oppose the very notion that humans in web design are replaceable. Over the last year, I’ve read a handful of posts about “The End of Client Services” and have privately snarked the minutiae of these arguments until the whistle blows. Yet, over the same year, I’ve seen a handful of shops I respect and admire close their doors. My assumptions that gumption and people skills are enough to keep the doors open have been challenged.

In order to win, you need to do more than the Machine; faster, better, and for cheaper. It makes perfect sense to me why smaller shops at the end of their fiscal runway get tired and want to assimilate into a startup or some Behemoth Talent Vacuum.

New tools, Lord, Lord, so many new tools
I think the waning of s/web design/client services/UX/ is all somewhat connected to all these tools. The needs of the multi-device web are ever increasing, but timelines are inversely decreasing.

All these tools –and Lord knows there are lot of tools out there– exist to bridge the gap between speed and complexity of the Web. What if instead of hissing, confusing, angry, “not how I’d do it” steam drills, these are just the next iteration of getting things done?

All my thoughts on this “Web Designer vs. Machine vs. Startups” hubbub culminated in a couple recent episodes of Freakonomics Radio. The first was an episode with Kevin Kelly, a co-founder of Wired Magazine.

Kelly maintains a book/blog called Cool Tools, a collection of over 1,500 tools to help simplify your life. 1,500 tools would not simplify your life, nor should it, that is too many tools. But as Kelly points out, exposure doesn’t hurt and maybe there’s a tool out there that can help simplify your life.

”A tool is really just an opportunity with a handle.“ – Kevin Kelly, co-founder of Wired Magazine

I was struck by the profoundness of that thought and I feel it really speaks to modern day web design.

Second, in the episode titled “How Safe Is Your Job”, Stephen Dubner unearths the topic of Creative Destruction. This very topic. Are machines taking our jobs? The answer is “Yes. Inevitably”, but we’re offered a consolation. In the end, market disruption typically creates more wealth which creates new industries which creates new opportunities.

My faith in Trickle Down Economics is not that strong, but I think we’ve already seen how something like a free CMS can disrupt big box CMS, and spawn a whole new industry of themesmiths. That lowers the cost of web design but also creates a market where thousands of people in our $21 Billion Industry can create small (or large) self-sustaining businesses.

A short prophetic post from 2013 by Paul Boag about “The Decline of the Webpage” outlines his thoughts on how web pages as we know them might just fade away into history, replaced by data-mining algorithms like Readability, Google Now, or Facebook. Reports of the Web’s death are greatly exaggerated, but Paul’s vision isn’t too far fetched. Every day my search results get richer, and by “richer” I mean I click through to less sites because Google has siphoned off the information I need.

Paul goes on to explain (in his talks, podcast, and book, which I recommend) it’s similar to how we no longer have “Chief Electricity Officers” around the office helping us plug things in and making the move to light bulbs. We’ve adapted. It’s quite possible Web Design is a temporal industry that simply morphs into something different.

I’m somewhat comforted by the idea that our jobs just fade away and are replaced by something else. We’re the first step on the next 200 years of the Web.

It was in a recent Rapidfire episode on Shop Talk that Chris first harkened on the parallel to the tale of John Henry. A sucker for Web Design analogies, that one really struck a chord with me which is how we ended up here. Then on another Shop Talk with Wren Lanier we talked about how “Software is eating the Web Design Industry”. Wren wisely pointed out that as an Industry, we love and celebrate “disruption” until it comes knocking on our door. Now I’m trying my best to be less defensive and more welcoming of it all.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m stubborn enough to want to fight the Machine and let the Keyboard get the best of me. But reading John Henry’s tale as a parable for burnout, I take a step back and realize it’s probably not worth it and I should seek out the new tools that simplify my life.

There is one thing we can do. The one thing we can do for the Machines that eventually come to replace us is to set the bar as high as possible. If you’re gonna take my job, Robot, you’d better do a damn good job. I feel that’s a part of John Henry’s legacy.

Thanks to Chris Coyier for originally locking into the John Henry analogy.

http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/responsive_web_design_tips

Recently, I was asked by a designer client to review a design he was working on. He hadn’t yet designed for responsive, and he was curious about things to keep in mind while he was designing. This proved to be a good exercise for me as it allowed me to document some things I’ve learned over the past few years, and I thought it might be helpful to share them here.

Content Priority
This first consideration is less a design thing than a planning thing, but it’s super important for the designer. At Sparkbox, we religiously map out the order that the content should appear on each page when at the smallest browser width. We call this the Content Priority. It’s helpful for the designer as it allows us to make informed decisions and helps us know where content should go if we decide to have content side by side on desktop width for example.

Think About How Things Respond
Okay, captain obvious, thanks for the tip! Seriously though, if you’re designing at desktop width and in a creative zone (or in a hurry), it’s easy to overlook how groupings of content collapse down at smaller viewport widths. Hopefully you know where the content should go at these smaller widths (Content Priority FTW).

The other day, I designed a module to a website that had text on the left and an image on the right. Both these elements were contained inside a white box, and the photo was cropped on the top, left, and bottom. Even though the photo had a white background, a shadow bled off the top and created an issue when, at smaller viewports, it appeared below the text. There was an abrupt transition below the text to the image when my plan was to have the white bleed into the photo. Completely missed it until we got into dev, which leads us to the next point...

Where does it break?
Inevitably, there are going to be things that you either don’t anticipate or don’t know how to handle when content is displayed in smaller viewports. That’s okay. In fact, I’ve found it’s often better to leave as much of this as possible for the browser because A) things appear very different when viewed and interacted with in the browser and B) it allows our frontend developers to make some design decisions and come up with something maybe I wouldn’t have thought of.

For us, a lot of design of the sites we build happens in the browser, by seeing when the design breaks down and addressing those elements when that happens. Often, we’re asked about what breakpoints to use, but with new devices being released so frequently, it makes sense to create breakpoints when needed as the design requires it. It's like Stephen Hay said, “it doesn’t matter how many pixels it is or how many ems it is. Where it breaks, that’s your breakpoint. Hence the name 'breakpoint'."

Reuse of Styles
This is one I often struggle with. As a designer who’s not building production code, it’s easy to crank along in Photoshop or Sketch and create tons of variations on styles. For example, I tend to create many different shades of gray to achieve just the look that’s right. Well, this drives devs crazy because in actuality, we could probably use just a few to achieve a great design with far less budget impact.

Source Order
HTML source order is important to keep in mind because it can often affect design as it gets translated across viewport widths. Why? Take for example, if at a desktop viewport width you have a sidebar column with a search field. When the viewport is at its smallest width, the sidebar elements may then appear below the main content. This means you’ve placed the priority of the search field lower than almost anything else on the page, and that may not be desired. While there are ways around this using JavaScript, it’s always nice to make the source order work to your advantage whenever possible and start to talk about how the code is structured during the design phase.

Stacking Items
Displaying images or text or a combination of the two in multiple columns on a desktop viewport width is a nice way to display like content. However, it’s good to keep in mind what happens to these items when the viewport width is smaller. You may know that on smallest width, these items will simply stack. But what happens if you have 3 columns of information at a tablet width? What about 4? What if your client manages content and there could be any number? Obviously, this presents challenges. Many times, these problems can be solved in-browser and sometimes with the creation of optional styles such as full, half, or third-width versions of the specific module you’re working on to give the client options that don’t make the design fall apart.

Performance
This is a hot topic now in responsive web design. One of the “knocks” on responsive web design is that it performs poorly and drives up load time. We believe that it’s not an issue of responsive web design, but the lack of making effort to address the true problems when building a site. Designers love to load the page with beautiful, full-width photos and videos, which can be great. Just make sure to keep performance in mind and keep the lines of communication open with the rest of the team.

Navigation
We spend a lot of time working on site navigation. There’s a lot to consider here: What kind of trigger will be used to open the nav at small viewport widths? The hamburger icon? Something else? If it’s a multi-level navigation, designing expandable menus for mobile devices is an art form in itself. Make sure to know how users want to navigate and where you or your client want to drive traffic as that could–and should–play an important part in how the navigation is designed. For example, is the desire for the user to drill down into the menu as deep as possible, or is there a desire for the user to hit a “parent” level page that has content or products that will help the user navigate?

Javascript fallbacks
We all love beautiful transitions and animations that make websites a joy to experience. I believe these are important, and often necessary, polish items that can give context to the user when the navigation opens or content is revealed. However, keep in mind that you should implement fallbacks for those users with javascript turned off. I’ve seen a few examples of this where main navigation wouldn’t work with javascript off, which is obviously a bad thing.

Typography
There’s much attention that needs to be paid to typography as the viewport width changes. Type sizes, line lengths, paragraph spacing, and margins all may need to be adjusted. Headlines reflow and may need to be re-evaluated at various widths. Spacing between content sections may need to be emphasized more at smaller widths. It makes most sense to tweak this in browser as you can test typography on actual devices.

And Also...
This is obviously not an exhaustive checklist. It’s simply things I’ve found that are helpful for me to think about when designing a responsive website. I’m sure there are other important considerations too–some specific to designers, developers, or both.

https://medium.com/philosophie-is-thinking/the-when-why-and-how-of-designing-in-browser-3c7fa2ebcb94

If you’re a designer in the tech industry, you’ve probably been exposed to or read articles about a hot topic in design today: designing in browser. The concept is as simple as it sounds. Rather than spending hours, days, weeks and months designing those pixel-perfect comps in Photoshop, a mainstay in a waterfall-oriented development process, designing in browser allows you to take whatever sketches and preliminary work you’ve conducted and enables you to jump right into the text editor and emerge with shippable code.

But how do you design in browser effectively?
How do you know when the project calls for it?
Let me walk you through when, why and how you might decide to design in browser vs. doing it a more traditional way. Which, for the sake of this article, will be designing in Photoshop.

To start, my version of “designing in browser” is less “designing” and more “hacking in browser to get what you want”. To me, design is solving a problem for your users. The “in browser” is just another tool in your arsenal, the fastest way to ship clean code that has a considered design via a series of collaborative meetings and sketching.

When do you design in browser?

There are many articles in the tech community that sing the praises of designing in browser — it’s future of web design, we should Kill Photoshop — to name a couple. I agree that while designing in browser can be your go-to when kicking off a design project, there will be times when factors — client needs, nature of deliverable, time constraints, for instance — don’t allow you to work that way. Here are some potential scenarios where you wouldn’t:

The client’s needs aren’t suited for designing in browser. You may tell yourself, “well, just don’t work with them!” But we all know this can’t always be the case. Maybe the client’s priority at the time is to present a highly polished website to stand out from their competitors or to get more capital from their investors. Perhaps their feature backlog is ever-changing, or they have many fundamental issues with their vision. In this case, traditional wireframing, then comping, may be the most efficient way to prototype their needs for their users.

Many clients see visuals as results. Sometimes it’s more effective to deliver 10–20 high fidelity comps in one week as opposed to 1–5 working, but uninspiring, pages.

The system and layouts of the website in question are too complex to visualize and code at the same time. We’re human. Most of us have limited brain capacity to think in two spheres. Whereas some may tell you that coding and designing go hand in hand, it’s really tough for me to envision a complex layout with many moving parts while writing divs for it at the same time. Studies show that we suck at multitasking, and designing in browser often feels that way. Granted, time and experience will definitely make you better at visualizing faster and writing cleaner code. So keep at it.

<p class=”em”>This sometimes happens. Like, whaaaaaa?</p>
You’re in the “refinement” stage of design. Let’s say you’re past the point of MVP with your project. You have a working website with a decent layout, and you’re ready to add more features. If your users have expressed pain points over certain design decisions you made in browser, like maybe that call to action wasn’t clear enough, or they don’t know what to read first on the page, it could be an opportunity to jump back into Photoshop and revisit those pain points in a thoughtful, refined way.

To me, the biggest challenge of designing in browser can be summed up by Andy Budd:

“As the best design tools are the ones that put the smallest barrier between the creator and their creation (the pencil is a good example of this) designing in the browser adds an unnecessary level of cruft to the process.”
— Andy Budd
To add onto that: You actually enjoy the process and craft of pushing those pixels around on the artboard. Many web designers come from formal graphic design backgrounds. Taking it slow and scrutinizing over every detail is in our blood.

The reasons why we design in browser vary greatly, and the approach we take highly depends on the task that is called upon us. That being said, when the situation does call for designing in browser, here’s my take on it.

How do you begin designing in browser?

There are so many ways to begin a project. Let’s say for this article, I use the way philosophie typically begins a project with the product owner(s) of a newly incorporated, newly funded startup: a kickoff. Many thought leaders in design, Dan Mall for one, detail ways to facilitate a successful kickoff, so I won’t go into the details here.

During our kickoff, let’s say we’ve determined a set of users and their pain points for our product, a brand statement defining the what, why and how, a hypothesis statement that we intend to solve with our first sprint, perhaps even rudimentary wireframes or a feature list. At this point, we’ve gained a vague understanding of who we’re designing for and what the client wants to convey to them.

I like to start off with moodboards. They help to paint the picture of the brand expression without wasting too much of my time and effort. For this, I tend to trawl Pinterest, Dribbble, whatever designer fodder I can find to curate visual options for the client.


Even if the visuals change over time, moodboards are easy to create and can act as a quick win to get the client in your favor.
From here, I pick a framework, the skeleton for which to quickly markup the layout and paste in the UI. For marketing or consumer-facing sites, I tend to prefer Foundation because the options are presented to you in the code. They’re more rudimentary, in my opinion, and easier to override than Bootstrap. Bootstrap is a robust framework ideal for admin-facing applications. There’s less work out of the gate with Bootstrap, but more options to painstakingly overwrite in the CSS.

Next, the style guide. Beginning with a style guide, or a series of “style tiles” is pretty important to keep your design elements organized and succinct within a design system. I won’t go into the importance of style guides because the reasons have been well-explained by others, but I will say that a style guide is the easiest way to make sweeping design changes as they come down the pipeline. And that’s one of the biggest reasons we design in browser in the first place. I’m accustomed to building style guide UI elements manually on an as-needed basis, but you can use KSS methodology, or even a gem like Hologram to help you automate the generation.


Finally, the composition. Something I try to keep in mind: don’t lose sight of your design principles. Eye movement, hierarchy, contrast — it’s easy to get lost in code. When I used to exclusively design in Photoshop, it enabled me to think more conceptually and granularly about the design: I could experiment more with new ways to call to action, a new layout, a compelling animation. Designing in browser fundamentally prevents you from thinking outside the box in that regard. The easiest way for me to do it is to go from lowest fidelity to highest. That means, plain text, then html markup, then add framework layout, then add selectors, then style selectors in CSS.


Plain text, then html markup, then add framework layout (Foundation in this case), then add selectors, then style selectors in CSS.


Using browser tools

So you’ve gone and created the first iteration of your site in browser, and it’s time to review with the client. This is where the magic happens. Rather than the typical unending back-and-forth design loop, you can potentially take care of most to all design feedback in one meeting. Here’s how I use the inspector in Chrome:

Client wants to make a copy change. Open the inspector and “edit text”. Screenshot the change.


We decide to add a new content column in a section on the page. Open inspector, “edit HTML”, copy and paste column. Boom, new column. Screenshot the change.


We need to increase the size of a radio button, tucked inside a form. Click magnifying glass, right click the button. The magnifying glass hones in on an element nested inside a parent. Make the changes in the styles. Screenshot.


We need to change the color of something, make something bigger, anything related to style. Edit styles, screenshot screenshot screenshot.




Note that I prefer taking screenshots over using Chrome tools to save the code. This is because using the inspector is not the way to generate the most beautiful, semantic code; it’s just a cheat to experiment with a design decision or get approval from a client. Using screenshots, however, lets you preserve the change and figure out the best way to integrate that with your code base later.

Working in teams

Disclaimer: philosophie uses Pivotal Tracker as the project management tool of choice, and usually Ruby on Rails as our go-to stack.

Rather than a typical waterfall-oriented design process I described in the beginning of this story, designing in browser allows you to work in sprints with the rest of your team. The first sprint may consist of chiefly foundation or bootstrap styles. This is merely the MVP design. From there, the second sprint can slowly work on the branding, revisit typefaces, improving hierarchy, and other improvements you and your team have decided. You can even enter the refinement period here and use Photoshop, which I mentioned earlier.

As for how we integrate design stories into Pivotal Tracker, I’ve found that it’s been effective to create user stories for front-end tasks, separate from back-end stories. This way, you can let design run ahead of development, or let the engineer create models and controllers first, leaving you to style the view. It’s interchangeable.

For instance: while you as the front-end dev can create and style the static pages such as the homepage, a contact form, or text page, the back-end dev generates inputs and views for the login. Then, the front-ender can jump on the login pages and style them.


The same user story, but the view layer (front-end) is tagged and separated from the other part of the story
How has this worked in the “real world”?

On a recent client project, we determined that designing in browser was the best way to keep within budget but still deliver a fresh, clean look. I quickly mocked up layouts and pages in using Bootstrap as my framework and Sublime Text as my text editor, making low-hanging-fruit improvements where relevant. I also worked in tandem with developers as I mentioned in the previous section, taking on front-end stories and bugs while they worked on the back-end.

Midway through the process, the client wanted to explore new home page directions. Not wanting to limit myself on design, I decided that Photoshop was the best way to execute several well-composed iterations of the home page. It was relatively painless to go through a couple of rounds of feedback on just one page.

With these new styles composed in Photoshop, and with my UI elements in place, I merely had to change the styles in one place, and the whole site conformed to the new homepage design.



Concluding thoughts

There is no end-all-be-all to designing for the web. Just because you mostly design in browser doesn’t mean you should give up Photoshop.

For me, the most valuable aspect of designing in browser is to curtail the pain that comes with traditional design process and to work with your team in the leanest way possible without having to sacrifice of your own design principles.

http://www.newmediacampaigns.com/blog/examples-of-animation-in-web-design

Of the trends I identified in our recent post on what to expect for the web in 2015, animation is among the most important. But the purpose of the post was a high-level overview of what’s next in web design — more about the what than the why — and this topic deserves a little more attention.

Animating elements of an interface serves both a functional and aesthetic purpose: when applied thoughtfully, it can increase a user’s delight and make an interface easier to use by providing context. When I tap a menu item and the screen “slides” to the left, for example, my expectation is that by hitting “back” I’ll slide in the opposite direction. That context helps me figure out how to get around the the screen reliably and, when an interface meets my expectations, I feel more confident using it.

Nearly all NMC projects use animation for both small aesthetic flourishes, such as the fading-in buttons on our Pacify web project, as well as larger scale interactions, such as the Tryon Palace tour map. We’ve long championed JavaScript over Flash which, though originally a decision made simply as a matter of resources (both human and computational), has served us well now in the age of mobile devices that don’t run Flash.

Beyond the rise of smartphones and tablets, the online tools for prototyping interactive animation such as Marvel, InVision, Framer, Pixate — as well as traditional desktop apps like Origami / Quartz Composer, After Effects, Form, and even Apple’s Keynote — have become so sophisticated that even casual users can learn them. This means that developing working animation demos is easier than ever and simplifies the process of implementing them in our user interfaces. Below are some examples of websites using animation not just for a logo’s whimsical hover state but more and more as a central storytelling part of the sales process.

For years, designers for the web produced flat, static representations of web pages for clients. The actual pages, when built, scroll and adapt and respond; static comps don’t really capture the state of a web interface and how it all fits together:

You tap a button and the form just ...appears? You swipe to delete an item and it just vanishes? That’s super weird and un-natural. Nearly nothing in the real world does anything as jarringly as just swapping states. It would feel like a glitch.

Oh, ok sweet. You made some notes — it just “slides in.” How? Quickly? Does it bounce back? Cushion in? Static design doesn't provide context between states.
Mirroring the rise of browsers and devices powerful enough to animate a full 60 frames per second are prototyping tools easy and cheap enough to use in routine production. The coming years will reflect a totally new way of designing our products that solve clients’ problems, which will also mean a totally new way of showing that work to clients in progress. After all, how could you represent a fully responsive e-commerce site like Melanie F just in Photoshop or even Sketch? Animation for the web — and the tools we use to design it — are just getting started.

WHY YOU DON’T NEED DEVICE SPECIFIC BREAKPOINTS

BY JUSTIN AVERY, 28 OCT 2014 : OPINION

With the ever growing number of different mobile, tablet, laptops, monitors, televisions, watches — and whatever else will communicate information to you visually — it's finally time to put to rest those device specific breakpoints.

Recently I was fortunate to spend some time with Brad Frost. One of our conversations — most of which weren't anything to do with the industry — was around the need to upgrade to the latest round of devices (the iPhone 6 had recently been released).

I was joking about coming across my first iPad (2011 iPad 2) and how comically large it seemed after using the iPad Mini. With so many new devices that were now hitting the shelves and the fact that we're no longer wowed that there's a new bigger and skinnier phone has meant that for some the upgrade to the latest version isn't something that is as vital as it once was.

DESIRE TO UPGRADE

One of the reasons behind wanting to upgrade to the latest device was the need to start testing our own and our client websites to see what we needed to fix.

With the iPhone 6 new larger screen, and it's companions 6+ even bigger screen this would surely introduce a new set of design problems for all the sites we only launched since the iPhone 5 resize.

Surely this, along with the High DPI Screen was going to warrant us to head out and upgrade to the latest bit of hardware.

RESPONSIVE DESIGN AT ITS BEST

The fact is that we didn't need to do anything.

Nothing. Nada. Zip.

Over the past 4 years (that's right, the idea has been around for that long and it's not going anywhere) we've been moving towards a more responsive web. We have flexible grids, we have flexible images, and we use media queries to rearrange our layouts when the viewport dictates.

Over the 4 years we have slowly moved away from device specific breakpoints in favour of content specific breakpoints, i.e. adding a breakpoint when the content is no longer easy to consume.

With this fundamental shift in thinking we no longer have to fear a new device — a new iPhone width — because we've already fixed our sites to work everywhere.

Lets take a look at three of the most common issues with new widths and why they no longer matter.

FORM FACTOR

This is actually a good reason for testing. The size of the phone has increased and therefore the way we interface with the phone will change. Luke Wroblewski has written about the form factor and possible solutions to navigation.

This is nothing new though. There have been larger phones on the market since the Samsung Note was released so many of the issues faced will have already been overcome.

Apple have released a double tap on the home button to move the top of the screen closer for tapping elements, but this form factor is not available across all devices so not something that provides a well rounded solution.

Form factor doesn't matter because you've already taken these screen sizes into consideration with other devices.

HIGH DPI

When the retina display (Apples marketing name for high DPI screens) was released it caused a world wide panic. First there was 1.5 high dpi which meant you needed a 38px icon to render nice and crisp when displayed at 25px. Then we had the 2x icon sizes and we needed a 50px icon to render nice and crisp when displayed at 25px.

At some point we got bored or resizing icons and worked out that if we used Font Icons or SVG icons then it didn't matter how good the screen would become because the vector looks beautiful and crisp EVERYWHERE.

High DPI/Retina doesn't matter because you've already updated all your logo's and icons to SVG and that scales to work on any device.

NEW VIEWPORT DIMENSIONS

For a little while we lost site of what Responsive Design really meant — and I mean the underlying theory of Responsive Design where we respond our content to fit any viewport — and we began to use device widths to target particular layouts towards.

We knew that browser and device sniffing was frowned upon and thought that we could achieve the same approach using only media queries. This spurred the 320, 480, and 768px media queries that kept with the iPhone 3/4 and iPad viewport dimensions. When the iPhone 5 was released a handful of use updated the 480px query to 568px to accommodate the slightly larger screen. Strangely we never looked at Android phone dimensions (probably because there's far too many of them).

Fortunately at some point we all became aware we were doing it wrong and fell back to allowing the content dictate our breakpoints. This has the greatest benefit of all, the ability to still serve our sites content perfectly regardless of the device sizes released to market.

New device size don't matter because you've already based your media query breakpoints on the content.

THE FUTURE

This won't be the last iPhone to be released, and it certainly won't be the last smart phone released with a new dimension.

Fortunately it no longer matters the size of the devices that are coming in the future because we're already prepared for them with our flexible grids, flexible images, and content focussed breakpoints.

The picture proposal has meant that in the future image sizes are no longer an issue either, although we do need to become better at setting the sizes attribute.

The biggest issue we're going to have now will be producing content for smaller screens. Screens that fit on your wrist. This is a problem less for responsive design to solve, after all we can't reduce the content to less than a single column.

Instead the solution will be in the format we serve our content. Making it available not just in between <html>..</html> tags, but also in formats like <xml> <rss> and json.









Developers and Designers — Dear Design Student — Medium
deardesignstudent.com · by Norcross
The Developers Are Due On Maple Street

A: Start thinking like a developer.

If you remember nothing else about developers, remember this: our core nature is to streamline, automate, and basically reduce things to their smallest possible element. This ethos drives almost every decision a developer makes. The other common thread about developers is that we’re inherently lazy. We don’t want to do things twice, and we automate anything and everything to avoid doing some things even once. Full confession: I’m a developer, so I’m biased as hell.


A good design comp is like a painting of a website. It’s often visually stunning, but nothing about the comp shows any intent, only the end result. You cannot look at a comp and determine how decisions were made, what constraints existed, or how things were prioritized. Furthermore, you cannot see how things are intended to act. Does this thing move when hovered? Is there a fade? Individually, these are minor things, but add them up and you’ve got a pretty picture riddled with questions. Questions a developer either has to have answered, or worse, has to figure out on their own.

You don’t want me, the developer, making assumptions about your design. I will probably assume wrong, or at the very least choose the path of least resistance. I’m a developer, it’s what I’ve been trained to do. So what can we do to avoid this?

Prioritize the needs of the design
I don’t believe designers want to design something ugly. I sure as hell don’t want to build something ugly. And when it comes to web projects, no one cares for a pretty face that can’t string a sentence together. Think of it as a Maslow’s Hierarchy for web development: start at the bottom with what is needed to actually solve the problem at hand (because remember, design is about solving problems, not changing the world or some other bullshit like that) and then work up from there. It’s much easier to apply nicer progressive elements that look cool once we know the site actually works.

Include me as early in the process as possible
Everyone on the A-Team had a specific role. So do we. And while we don’t get to blow up buildings or hide from the Federal government, we still need to play to our strengths. I have no interest in doing your part, as I imagine you have no interest in doing mine. In the interest in making my own role easier, so I will often bend over backwards to help you, when the result is getting something to build that doesn’t involve bending the laws of web physics. Make me part of your research process. I can often point out small things in a design that seem like throwaway items to you, but can make things very difficult for me, or more importantly, difficult for a user to enter. Also, I may be able to point out when a design doesn’t match up with the budget. I like making things fancy, but not at the expense of the core functionality that is being expected. Your wiggle could be half a day’s worth of development and cross-browser testing. And I will always prioritize functionality over a nicer coat of paint. Which brings me to my next point…

Consider the content at all times
Nearly all web design now is done in the context of a CMS. Whether it’s WordPress, Drupal, something custom, or whatever else exists out there, someone is gonna have to enter all the content. That someone isn’t me, and probably isn’t you either. In my experience, any content the client can see, the client will want the ability to change (even if they shouldn’t, but that’s another topic all together). Below is a short list of things to consider when putting together a design for a content driven site:

Keep image sizes as consistent as possible (especially aspect ratios)
Standardize your content formatting
Share style elements wherever possible
Favor repeatable elements over unique ones (They don’t have to be identical. Just not so unique that I have to write 8 template functions to handle minor differences)
Position elements in relative proximity for all breakpoints
Use varying content for placeholder elements
That last one is important. I can’t count how many times a comp has a grid-type layout and uses identical content for each item. Same image size, same character count, same punctuation, etc. As soon as real content is entered, the grid goes to shit. Uneven columns and truncated content can easily make a professional design look like an 8th grader’s first web project. In short: don’t include something that requires strict adherence to some arbitrary rule, unless that rule is already agreed upon and understood by all parties involved. More than once, hopefully, because often times a client may agree to this rule until they want to enter something (or their marketing team gets their hands on it) and decides it won’t work anymore. Which brings me to my last point:

Assume I know nothing about your design
It’s easy to forget that not everyone knows what you know. I’m as guilty of it as anyone. But unless I was involved at the very beginning of the process, there is information related to the design that I simply don’t know. It could be from a client interaction, the scope itself, or just an understood part of the process that doesn’t filter down to me. So make the assumption that I don’t know why you did anything. I don’t want a doctoral thesis on it, but I do want information. A comprehensive style guide is the beginning of this, but also having detailed notes about specific items can help me develop it in such a way that your design works without conflict, and the end user can actually use it. I can build damn near anything, but the more complex it is, the more time has to be spent by someone to explain it.

The bottom line: This isn’t unique to designers or developers. The exact same discussions (or a very similar version) are had between designers and pre-press techs, designers and printers, printers and binders, binders and trimmers, etc. Everyone thinks the person downstream (closer to the deadline) is a blocker, and everyone thinks the person upstream is an asshole. You can be each other’s biggest advocates or worst nightmares. Help each other out and what you’re making will be better off for it.




Style Guide Best Practices | Brad Frost
bradfrost.com · December 19, 2014
Style guides and pattern libraries are essential tools to help Web teams maintain sanity while creating experiences for our multi-device Web.

The benefits of style guides are many: they establish a common language, make testing easier, save time and effort, and create a useful reference to keep coming back to. And most importantly, it lays a future-friendly foundation for your organization to modify, extend, and evolve over time.

Make it happen

Obviously, in order to incorporate style guide best practices, you first need a style guide. Where to start? I’d recommend checking out all the great resources, tools, and examples on Styleguides.io to get buy-in from your organization.

A good first step towards establishing a style guide is to conduct an interface inventory to document your entire existing interface. It’s also essential to choose the right tools to help create your style guide.

Make it cross-disciplinary

Family Reunion
Family Reunion
One of the biggest pitfalls I see with style guides is that they are often created with only one discipline in mind. Developers create code standards and libraries to make their lives easier, while designers create interface pattern libraries to establish consistent design patterns.

Of course these are nobel endeavors, but a larger, more worthwhile goal is to create a tool that’s useful for designers, developers, project managers, business owners, and even third parties. A style guide can serve as a watering hole that helps everyone at an organization speak the same language and builds awareness/appreciation of the system.

Make it approachable

In order to be useful to everyone, the style guide should clearly convey what it is and why it matters. Some style guides (typically developer-specific ones) tend to be a bit muddy or jump straight into code samples. This can intimidate other disciplines and lead them to believe the resource isn’t for them.

Presentation matters, so take the time to design an approachable style guide.

Make it agnostic

Feature Block Pattern for South Tees Hospital Style Guide
Feature Block Pattern for South Tees Hospital Style Guide
Pattern-based design and development requires you to blur your eyes a little bit. When creating a design system built for reuse, it’s essential to take a step back from the current context and name things in an agnostic way. “Carousel”, not “Homepage Carousel”. “Filters” not “Product Grid Filters”. “Radio Button Group” not “Gender Select”. And so on.

Naming patterns in an agnostic way reduces duplication and leads to smaller, more efficient, more portable systems.

Make it contextual

Frost Finery Pattern Lab Lineage
Frost Finery Pattern Lab Lineage
Pattern libraries can be great, but they can often be an abstract concept. Too many pattern libraries in the wild don’t provide context to how and where patterns get used. Where are “Horizontal Tabs” used? What patterns make up the checkout template? If I make changes to the “Accordion” pattern, what’s going to break?

One of my favorite features of Pattern Lab is its ability to show what patterns make up any given pattern, and also show where the patterns are employed. This helps teams understand how global a pattern is and where they need to test/QA if changes are made to a particular pattern. The ability to traverse between in-context and out-of-context is massively helpful for designers and developers.

Make it maintainable


"You seek the holy grail" from Monty Python and the Holy Grail
Creating a style guide that is perfectly in sync with the production environment is the Holy Grail.

CSS and JS can be easily migrated from one place to another, but pattern markup is where things can get challenging.

I highly recommend Ian Feather’s article on how Lonely Planet created a style guide that is integrated with their production environment. Make a change to a pattern in the style guide, and boom, it’s updated in the production environment. Super clever stuff.

Lonely Planet Style Guide
Lonely Planet Style Guide
Unfortunately it’s difficult to scale this kind of solution (the myriad of available backend environments makes things difficult), but I’m encouraged by the tools, techniques, and thinking around this issue. The next version of Pattern Lab will allow people to use the templating engine of your choice, which can help get markup much closer to your backend production code. Also, things like the Pattern Lab Component Builder by Evan Lovely automagically updates the style guide whenever Sass gets changed.

It’s important to strive toward an automatically in-sync style guide to prevent the resource from becoming out-of-date and obsolete. Note: if you have experience/ideas of using Pattern Lab to keep the style guide and production environment in sync, please let me know.

Make it part of your workflow

The Guardian Style Guide
The Guardian Style Guide
A style guide needs to become an integral part of your organization’s process and workflow if it’s to continue to be a useful resource.

As sad as I am to admit it, the majority of style guides I’ve delivered to clients have been abandoned. It’s challenging to bake style guides into an organization’s workflow when you’re on the outside. True changes to process needs to come from within. Like most things, the real challenges here are people and organizational issues rather than technical ones. Thankfully I’m seeing more teams step up to the plate and champion style guides as the cornerstone of their workflows.

Make it visible

Starbucks Style Guide
Starbucks Style Guide
A style guide can only be useful if the organization knows it’s there. That’s why I strongly recommend making your style guide public.

Gasp! Horror! Wouldn’t that cause us to lose our competitive edge?

No.

There’s much to be gained by being open and sharing more, and making your style guide public is no exception.

Large organizations almost always have issues with the right hand not knowing what the left is doing. Documentation and resources are often buried in internal wikis or behind logins or some other unnecessary/archaic crap. By making your style guide public you’re not just making it visible to the outside world, you’re making it a lot more visible to the people within organization itself. And after all, those are the folks that will be making use of it.

Also, sharing your style guide serves as recruitment tool that shows you’re up to speed on modern Web best practices, and gives a glimpse into your tech stack, style, and workflow.

Make it bigger

IBM Design Language
IBM Design Language
Pattern libraries for Web teams are proving their worth over and over again. So why not widen the scope a bit, and create a hub for the many other areas that could benefit from a style guide? Brand assets, design language, voice and tone, and writing can and should be consistent and available. Use the Web style guide to start a broader conversation.

Make it last

No organization wants to perpetuate the “burn the whole thing down every 3-5 years” style of redesign. A good system is built to stand the test of time, and establishing a solid style guide can help make that happen.

That’s not to say things can’t change. But establishing a design system now makes those changes easier down the line. After all, even with an entirely new design, you’ll still need buttons, inputs, image types, and so on. Style guides are beneficial from Day 1, but become much more valuable as time goes on.

As someone who helps organizations do better work, I’m absolutely thrilled to see more people embrace style guides as an effective way to create and maintain resilient design systems. If you have questions or are interested in a workshop about style guides and more, please do get in touch.


Viewport sized typography with minimum and maximum sizes
eduardoboucas.com · June 18, 2015
Viewport units for typography are quite a cool toy to have in your responsive web design toolbox, as they allow you to size fonts relatively to the dimensions of the viewport. If you’ve never used them before, Chris Coyier’s article is probably a good place to start.

These units can produce really interesting results, but they must be used with caution. From my experience, there’s always a point where the font becomes unreadable on small screens, and sometimes too big on large screens. I end up setting a couple of media queries to set some boundaries on where the viewport units kick in.

As a result, I created a Sass mixin that abstracts what I wish you could more naturally in CSS: specify a minimum and a maximum size for the font while still using viewport based units. The mixin takes the viewport based size, a minimum value (in pixels), an optional maximum value (in pixels as well) and an optional fallback value, in whatever units you prefer, for browsers that don’t support viewport units.

There is no denying the influence of responsive approaches in our design and implementation efforts. What was once new and unknown is now the assumed standard. When I started down the path of understanding the impact of responsive web design, I had an easy time finding out how to do something with media queries, but I had a harder time finding out why I should do it a certain way. This article is an attempt to remedy this situation.

My intent is that it will serve as a helpful introduction for those of you attempting to understand the massive implications of the mobile-first approach and for those more experienced with the approach it can serve as a good refresher.

I will focus on the details of writing mobile-first media queries, and this will also include why we should do this and close with guidance for starting out. However, first we should look at some important distinctions in the phrase “mobile-first”.

Shades of Mobile-First

It is important for our discussion to distinguish that “mobile-first” has two distinct senses. Some might see this as unnecessary, but for the guidance I will share at the end of the article it is important.

Many are familiar with the philosophical approach put forth by Luke Wroblewski in his book entitled Mobile First. Luke writes about the design advantages of a mobile-first strategy, the biggest impact being the imposed constraints of mobile devices that force us to focus on the essentials. He also talks about how mobile devices have capabilities that allow us to enhance the experience (e.g. GPS, accelerometer, etc.). This is what I will refer to as mobile-first design.

However, this is not the only sense, and this article will focus on the second sense. The second sense I will refer to as mobile-first implementation. This uses the technical tenets of responsive design, as coined by Ethan Marcotte. This means that when we actually implement the interface (prototype or production), we start out designing at the smallest viewport possible (which we will call a “mobile viewport,” but someday this might be “watch viewport” as the smallest) and we then progressively add styles and sometimes other enhancements as the viewport increases.

Let’s now look at the how and the benefits of mobile-first media queries.

Creating Mobile-First Media Queries

Rather than explaining all the ins and outs of media queries in this section, I want to focus specifically on how the technique is technically accomplished. Let’s look at two different media queries and dissect their implementation. Please note that I’m keeping this simple so I will avoid any specific class naming structure or style.

12345678910111213141516
.sidebar {
  float: left;
  width: 25%;
} 
.content {
  float: left;
  width: 75%;
} 
@media (max-width: 40em) {
  .sidebar, .content {
     float: none;
     width: auto;
  }}
You can see this simple example at work in this CodePen demo. Resize the window to see the change take place.

In this sample, I have two elements that are using floats so that they are lined up horizontally, and I have percentage-based widths on both of them. Then I have a media query breakpoint where the floats are disabled and the width is restored to full width using the “auto” value.

What are the problems with this approach?

It forces us to “undo” styles through our media queries. This is not an efficient approach to managing your styles, but we should instead be adding styles.
Our original float styles go against the natural flow of HTML elements. Block elements naturally clear on the top and bottom and flow at 100%, so the “undo” styles are merely declaring explicitly what the elements already do naturally.
This does not allow us to embrace the same constraints that we may have used in our mobile-first design. We essentially are going in two different philosophical directions.
You can usually spot the implementations that start at large viewports and go down by the presence of “max-width” in the media queries. This is not always the case, but it is usually a pretty strong indicator. Now let’s look at another example:

1234567891011
@media (min-width: 40em) {
  .sidebar {
     float: left;
     width: 25%;
  } 
  .content {
     float: left;
     width: 75%;
  }}
Now let’s look at the advantages of this model, which are really the opposite of the problems we started with above (a demonstration of this is on CodePen as well).

Instead of undoing the floats as we go down, we only need to add the floats when we need them. This reduces a lot of unnecessary CSS.
In this instance we are taking what HTML gives us by default and not going against it unnecessarily. By default, browsers us give us what we want and need in smaller viewport so we utilize those defaults (i.e. block elements are set to width: auto by default).
Using this method we are philosophically on the same page of our mobile-first design.
Source Ordering: A More Complex Example

The example above is very simple and on purpose, but let’s look at a more complex example. One of the first things you will learn about and have to deal with is the problem of DOM source ordering.

Source ordering refers to how a document is rendered as a result of the DOM structure. The DOM renders top to bottom, and until the advent of flexbox we didn’t have a pure CSS method to decouple rendering from source order. Even though flexbox is exciting, we will never get away from considering source order as we create responsive interfaces.

In this third CodePen example you can see priority highlighted from left to right.

Source ordering is a very important concept to understand as you move into responsive web design. From the example above you can see when the viewport dips below 40em the most important content (labeled “first priority”) is on top. This is what we want to happen given the importance of limited space in small viewports.

Now you could get something similar in the desktop-down implementation, but what I’ve seen people do is fall into old tendencies of not thinking first about the importance of source ordering. Mobile-first design and implementation makes it an inescapable reality, and when these are paired together the result is a powerful solution. Then technologies like flexbox can be used as an enhancement when needed if the need to change the rendering order exists.

A Couple More Advantages

The mobile-first code above is a great example of responsible implementation through progressive enhancement. It is important to note that there are still old mobile browsers that do not support media queries, and it is helpful that they will receive the smaller viewport layout. There are other browsers that have issues with media queries, most importantly IE8 and below. You can polyfill media queries, or use a preprocessor solution.

Brad Frost on the advantages of mobile-first
Mobile-First implementation is more efficient and future-friendly (Image credit)

There is another important benefit to structure our media queries in this way, and that is performance. Tim Kadlec has done the research to show that using media queries in this manner can avoid unnecessary downloads. So, for instance, if you wanted to add a background image only at larger viewports or even swap out a smaller for a larger one, you save downloads and loading time. If I were to add an image to my sidebar in the example above, it would download and show up only when the viewport reaches at least 40em.

Manage Your Media Queries with Sass

Before I conclude, I recommend that you use a preprocessor to help you manage your media queries. There are countless options and even preprocessor syntaxes for handling this (Sass, Less, Stylus). I prefer a simpler approach and Chris Coyier has demonstrated a Sass mixin that I use in my projects. I will update it to use my preferred language.

12345678910111213
@mixin mquery($size) {
  if $size == small {
    @media (min-width: 30em) {
      @content;
    }  } 
  else if $size == medium {
    @media (min-width: 40em) {
      @content;      
    }  }}
Then we can reference it this way.

12345
.sidebar, .content {
  @include mquery(medium) {
    float: left;
  }}
This is great because we can centrally control our media query values, and we can always see how our elements are changing throughout all of our media queries. It used to bother me that my compiled CSS output contained repetitive media query syntax, but with minification and GZIP it is not a big increase. If it really bothers you and you use Grunt then Grunt can combine your media queries after the Sass processing.

Conclusion

When you are ready to go further in your reading and studies, start with 7 Habits of Highly Effective Media Queries, a great post by Brad Frost.

This article was meant to be a quick primer on the definitions, approach, and benefits to using mobile-first media queries. I wish you all the best as you continue to grow and embrace these new and exciting approaches that help better serve our clients and customers.



3 responsive design disasters (and how to avoid them)
webdesignerdepot.com
Responsive design methods are very helpful to developers because they allow us to serve content to the widest range of devices without having to maintain separate versions of the site and without some of the negative drawbacks to other methods such as scaling and fluid layouts.

This article will highlight the top 3 mistakes designers encounter with responsive designs, and will provide some strategies for avoiding these mistakes.

 

Scaling vs. fluid vs. responsive

There is a lot of confusion over these terms and designers often incorrectly use them interchangeably. In truth, each of these are distinct evolutionary steps in layout technique that have emerged over time in line with advances in technology.

Scaling layouts are designed to scale every element relative to every other element. They are responsive in the sense that they will scale the content dynamically in response to changes in the size of the viewport. The layout itself remains static, changing the size of every element to maintain a consistent appearance.

scale
Above: example of a scaling layout at different resolutions: the design sacrifices readability for consistency.

Fluid layouts are different because they scale container elements relative to the size of the viewport. This is achieved by using relative units such as ems to overcome the problem of shrinking text. The design can be broken by the user scaling it.

fluid
Above: example of a fluid layout at different resolutions: the design sacrifices consistency for readability.

Responsive layouts don’t scale anything. Instead, they change what is displayed depending on the size of the viewport.

responsive
Above: an example of a responsive layout at different resolutions.

 

Disaster 1) Wrapping menus

If you use a navbar at the top of your page, a responsive design is supposed to “snap” it to a more compact format when the page is displayed on a small screen. But this does not always work perfectly if the display area is wider than the break point, but too small to display all the menu items in a single line. The result is a menu that wraps.

wrap_menu
There are several ways to solve this problem. The first is to reduce the number of items displayed horizontally on the navbar by sorting them into categories and sub-categories. You can then use drop-down items to display the sub-categories when a category is selected.

The second way is to change the break point to a lower value. The actual number to use is the width at which your navbar starts to fail, not a specific device size.

The third way is to use a different menu for devices, such as a sliding drawer.

 

Disaster 2) Using fixed width images

Content areas are usually set to a size relative to the viewport. So when a fixed-width image is wider than the size of the area, image cropping occurs.

scroll
Above: example of a bad fixed-width image that is too large: now it has scroll bars and content is pushed off-screen.

You can avoid this problem by using relative units to set the width of the image, or if you use a framework that supports it (such as Bootstrap) you can use a responsive image class (eg: class=”img-responsive”).

resize
Above: The same element with a responsive image class approach: now scroll bar is gone.

 

Disaster 3) Element distortion

This one is a bit more obscure, but essentially what happens when your layout is displayed on a small viewport is that any unhandled columns behave like rows. This is a problem because the distortion of the content unintentionally changes the hierarchy of your design.

wrap
Above: column becomes a row, distorting content.

The solution is obvious, yet it is surprising how many people struggle with it: simply set the height, width, and padding of the element explicitly. If it moves out of position and covers other elements, you can force it to be where you want by wrapping it in a div and setting margins.

 

Planning helps avoid mistakes

This article has discussed only the 3 most commonly encountered responsive design disasters, but there are plenty of other ways for a good design to go wrong. Preventing errors is not too difficult. Modern browsers have built-in responsive layout testing, so plan your design well and test often.

Brad Frost was showing me some slides from one of his talks recently. He had some graphics that demonstrated different approaches to where a style guide can fit into a team’s process. As you might imagine, it’s a matter of just having one or not that will determine its effectiveness.

I thought I would attempt to explain my own thoughts on these approaches based on my own experiences.


The Sidelines


Or maybe we could call it the “after the fact” model. The idea is that you have a Style Guide, but it’s this separate thing that exists outside of the actual process. You have to maintain and update it separately. Changes to the site aren’t reflected in the Style Guide unless you take the time to do that. Changes to the Style Guide aren’t reflected in the site unless you do that.

Useful as a reference, mayyyybe. I’ve worked on a Style Guide like this. It was slow to gain any use at all and was quick to be abandoned.

The Dictator


In this approach, the Style Guide is the law. Nothing goes into production that isn’t a part of the Style Guide. If something is needed on the site, it is integrated into the Style Guide then is available for use on the site.

Adoption of the Style Guide, of course, is high because it has to be. Everything is documented. Those are potentially good things. This is also potentially frustrating - the process can be slower, which is sad since speed is a big reason to use a Style Guide in the first place.

There is also a danger that you’re “designing a Style Guide”, not “designing a website”.

The Hippie Colony


Everything is connected, man. The Style Guide builds the website, but the website builds the Style Guide as well. It’s just one set of assets, packaged up in different ways. One way looks like a Style Guide, one way looks like a website.

This can be nice, as you could work on either one and have the changes reflected in both. The only potential danger here is that it might be too good to be true. Discussions might become disjointed. The Style Guide might not stay as updated as you might assume it would.

The Exhaust


In this model, you generally work on the site itself. The Style Guide is built from production assets. It essentially becomes part of testing. “Does the Style Guide still look correct and cohesive after these changes?” The potential danger of this method is that people stop caring about the guide because of its placement at the end of the process.

The CodePen Style Guide is a bit like this, but I’m hoping to make it more hippie-like.

The Answer

Never is one, I’m afraid.

Mobile-first is a great workflow | Donny Wals
blog.donnywals.com · March 18, 2015
One of the first questions a client might ask you when you start talking about his new website site is “Will it be responsive?”. And the answer to that question will more often than not be “Yes, it will”. Especially now that Google will penalize websites that aren’t mobile friendly it’s important that you make sure that your site works well on mobile devices. How do you approach responsive webdesign in a good way? Even though I am not a designer I’d say mobile-first.

Different approaches to responsive web design

When you’re doing a responsive webdesign there’s a couple of ways to do it. Some people use Photoshop and design three different versions of their website, one for mobile phones, one for tablets and one for the desktop. Others just make one of these three and design the rest during development in the browser.

If you only design one of the three big options, which one should it be? And when you start to build the website, where do you start? Do you do the desktop version first since it’s easier for you as a developer? Or do you start with the tablet version because it’s in the middle of the spectrum? Or do you let the client decide and start with the one that makes them the happiest?

These are just a few of the options you have when you’re doing responsive web design, there isn’t a way that is forced upon you by anybody and you’re free to choose whatever you feel is most efficient. But in practice there seems to be one approach in the development phase that works every time for me. That approach is mobile-first.

What is mobile-first?

Mobile-first means exactly what you probably think it means, it’s when you start your process with the mobile phone. Ideally you will start both the design and the development phase by thinking about mobile straight away. My experience is, however, that clients prefer to see designs for how the website will look on a big screen with all the bells and whistles you might add. So designers tend to not really work from a mobile first perspective because they focus on what the client likes to see. This probably doesn’t apply to every designer and every client but it does apply to most designers and clients I’ve worked with.

When you enter the development phase, the approach you take is in your hands, you can decide where to start. And deciding to start mobile first isn’t just a matter of preference. There are very valid reasons to approach the development phase from a mobile-first perspective.

Why mobile-first?

When you are building a responsive website there’s a lot of things to consider, how does this look on a screen that is X wide? Should module Y be visible on that screen? Thinking about everything for every screen is overwhelming, there’s so much going on and you get so little for free when you’re building a website. So you’re going to have to start somewhere and I prefer that somewhere to be the smallest screen I will develop for.

Constraints

A mobile phone is not only the smallest, but also the most constraint and possibly even the most used device that people use to browse your website with. Obviously this doesn’t apply to every website in the world but do not underestimate the amount of mobile browsing people do. Because of these factors it makes sense to first perfect the browsing experience on the small screens.

And since it’s also the most constrained browsing experience you will have to focus on the parts of your app that really matter to your users. This will make sure that you don’t just add a lot of noise because it might look cool or pretty.

Development speed

If you’ve made a responsive website before from a desktop first approach you probably noticed that you had to ‘undo’ a lot of your styling and scripting. I’d like to illustrate this with a little bit of code. The code will take an unsorted list and turn it into a nice navigation bar for the desktop view. On mobile the list will be shown as a list.

123456789101112131415	.nav-list{list-style:none;margin:0;}.nav-listli{padding:0;display:inline-block;}@media(max-width:600px){.nav-listli{display:list-item;}}
Do you notice how we first set .nav-list li to a non-default value, inline-block and then on screens smaller than 600 pixels we set .nav-list li back to it’s default value. Let’s rewrite this from a mobile-first perspective.

1234567891011121314	.nav-list{list-style:none;margin:0;}.nav-listli{padding:0;}@media(min-width:600px){.nav-listli{display:inline-block;}}
This is a small example so the difference isn’t dramatic but the implications are significant. Instead of adding and removing styles we are simply adding more styles when the screen is at least 600 pixels wide. By taking this approach it’s much more clear what’s going on and it’s also harder to make mistakes.

With the navigation list example in mind, imagine that we want to add a border and some padding to the list items, but only for the desktop view. Let’s compare both approaches again, shall we?

desktop first

1234567891011121314151617181920	.nav-list{list-style:none;margin:0;}.nav-listli{padding:1em;border:1pxsolid#333;border-radius:.5em;display:inline-block;}@media(max-width:600px){.nav-listli{display:list-item;padding:0;border:none;border-radius:0;}}
mobile first

1234567891011121314151617	.nav-list{list-style:none;margin:0;}.nav-listli{padding:0;}@media(min-width:600px){.nav-listli{display:inline-block;padding:1em;border:1pxsolid#333;border-radius:.5em;}}
As you can see the mobile first approach is a lot cleaner. Not only is it cleaner, it’s also safer. We don’t have to worry about resetting certain styles back to their defaults like we have to in our desktop-first approach.

Of course you still have to keep an eye out for cascading accidents because sometimes you set something for mobile that will have to be reset for your desktop view. But in my experience this happens a lot less often with mobile-first than it does with desktop-first.

Adding javascript is easier than removing it

I just showed you that when it comes to css it’s a lot easier to stack on more styles than it is to reset them to defaults for mobile. The same applies for javascript. I usually find myself initializing a lot less (complex) modules for mobile. When you take a mobile-first approach with this you will not initialize certain things at first. Once you know that you’re on a large screen machine you can start initializing your larger, more complex modules that are intended for desktop use.

Not only is it easier to initialize things when you know you need them, it’s also a lot faster. Imagine executing some heavy javascript on a mobile phone only to find out that the module won’t even be used because the target elements are hidden. That’s a waste of precious resources that you might have used to get your page up and running on the device really quick.

Conclusion

In this post I explained to you what a mobile-first approach is from the perspective of a developer. I also showed you how this impacts the process of writing code. Going in mobile-first will prevent you from having to write a lot of ‘reset this to default’ css. It’s also easier for the javascript part of your application. You won’t initialize thing that you don’t need and this generally makes your pages render faster as well.

I’m not saying that a desktop-first approach is worst in every case or scenario, I’m also not saying that the design process has to be mobile first. But thinking about the smallest most constrained devices does seem to result in faster and more focused websites. It also seems to lead to a more solid code base and happier developers.



Clarifying The 80/20 Hybrid Approach to Designing in the Browser - Inspect Element
inspectelement.com · by Tom Kenny · March 11, 2015
You’re risking the quality of your design work if you rely solely on designing in the browser. That’s what I said when I wrote about a more appropriate approach to designing in the browser, called The 80/20 Hybrid Approach to Designing in the Browser:

Unless you think and dream in HTML and CSS, designing in the browser puts an unnecessary barrier between your great design ideas and the most effective way you can actually design them. You can’t manipulate your design directly with code. The HTML and CSS code effectively acts as a middleman between your brain and your design work. Why would you want something getting in the way of that?
Feedback

I had some fantastic feedback about that article, with the vast majority finding it useful. However, I did spot a fairly well known front-end developer (who I hadn’t heard of at the time) call it a certain word I won’t repeat here. Despite me saying the approach might not work for everyone, he still decided to attack it. If another process works for you, great, but I’m not going to hate the way someone else does something just because I disagree. I welcome constructive criticism as long as it is, well, contructive, but attacking it and using hateful words is pathetic.

I don’t want to link to it due to the foul language but I do want to pull out a few quotes because I don’t really think he understood what I was saying and it will help explain the approach to you too.

“You don’t actually design in the browser”
I’m sure you’ll agree that seems a bit odd so we’re not off to a good start. Apparently, it’s more about “creating browser-based design mockups/comps, as opposed to static comps” which is something you can absolutely do with the 80/20 approach. I didn’t say you can’t. You don’t have to show the client your static mockups. I’m just putting forward the idea that designing in the browser exclusively can harm the creative process. You can absolutely present your work to the client in the form of HTML and CSS if you wish but that’s a topic for another time.

Creating browser-based design mockups isn’t designing in the browser, it’s presenting in the browser which are clearly two different things.

“Creating comps like this puts many designers out of their comfort zones. Many feel they have to learn to code, or “think in HTML and CSS”. Those who know that isn’t true can still feel awkward pairing up with a developer to visualize designs. That said, I think that learning CSS can be a useful addition to a designer’s toolbox.”
I completely agree that web designers should learn CSS as it makes us better understand the environment we design for. Coding knowledge is implied in the 80/20 approach because 20% of the creative process happens when building the site.

“We sure do like our comfort zones”
Comfort zones can be dangerous but there’s nothing wrong with staying in your comfort zone in some areas. If you can stick in your comfort zone with your process, it frees you up to expand out of your comfort zone in other, more important areas. Right now I’m learning how to deliver much more value than the average web designer through more than just design. I’m going out of my comfort zone by learning copywriting to help my clients with another aspect of their websites. Clients don’t really care about your process, they care about results.

The next two points were placed under the headline “Flimsy Arguments”. Everything I write on Inspect Element has to be substantial, so I’ll tell you why he is wrong.

“The author states that the desire to increase the speed of design and development is the driving force behind designing in the browser. While speed may be a factor, it’s arguably not the main factor, and certainly not the only one. More important, for example, is bridging the traditional gap between what the client sees in a comp versus the end result.”
It’s fair to say people want to show clients their designs in the browser which is relatively simple to do if you know HTML and CSS. The real problem is how responsive web design adds a significant amount of time to the process. In my experience of talking to other designers and researching this myself, I’ve found that this is the biggest issue. Like I said earlier, you can present your work as HTML and CSS no matter what approach you take.

“The author then proceeds to make the case for Photoshop instead of code (albeit with an 80/20 split). Nothing wrong with that, but the author’s personal experience with code yielding “dull” designs does not mean that code yields dull designs. It most likely means that the author tried getting into code too soon, or skipped sketching altogether, or is simply not as comfortable in code. I would agree that might not work out well. But in that case it’s the design process at fault, not the fact that code is used at all.”
Code doesn’t necessarily yield dull design but it’s much harder to be creative with the barrier of code. Moving elements on a page and experimenting is so much easier and quicker in a dedicated design tool than in CSS. If working in CSS comes easier to you than in a tool like Photoshop, then that’s amazing and I really mean it because it’s difficult. If you can truly create better work that way then you’ve got a major advantage over other designers in terms of speed.

It’s not just my personal experience. It’s also the experience of other designers I’ve spoken to. I’ve tried many ways to make designing in the browser work and I’m perfectly comfortable in CSS but I, along with other designers, have found greater success desining in a dedicated design tool first.

“Code can support the creative process”
Of course. In the 80/20 approach, code absolutely supports the creative process as you do about 20% of the creative work in CSS. In fact you can decide how much. The 80/20 isn’t set in stone.

It’s All About You

Luckily, I’m not trying to appeal to this one guy. The real goal of writing this follow up is to help you. I know it works extremely well for me and I know it also works for other designers, so hopefully this follow up helps clarify the approach so you can take it, or parts of it, and make it your own to create better work.

How to work with developers without losing your soul.



It’s hard, but it’s possible.

Order Group Team
We begin a series of short articles, in which we will feel sorry for ourselves as designers (but not only!). We’ll describe how our team deals with the implementation of individual projects. We’ll show you solutions to problems we encountered during design phase and development of production. We will also share the backstage of projects creation, starting from the brief, through the preliminary sketches, unused / discarded versions, up until the final feedback from the customer.

At the beginning we want to point out some quick tips on one of the most important part of our work — how not to go completely MAD in one room with a developer.



A developer?



When designing websites, apps or anything that requires code, each designer is at the mercy of the developer — the enigmatic man that everyone rumors about. Some of them supposedly haven’t seen daylight for several years, others haven’t changed their flannel shirts over the last season. We even heard of those who feed themselves through the process of photosynthesis from the monitor, slowly sipping blood of designers who had any remarks to their work.

In short they are specialists in their field, appreciating the accuracy and meticulously planning of every project that is entrusted to them.



What designers need to understand at the very beginning of cooperation with a developer is that the process of creation of things in graphic design and programming is not symmetrical — we can’t expect that our developer will take exactly the same amount of time as we (designers) will, in order to introduce amendments in the layout (although this often happens).


What you should look for and what to remember when working with developers? Here is a list made by us with the most important points that make life easier for both parties.



1. Speak the same language

The biggest challenge is to develop a common language and nomenclature which will help you to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings.
Usability, Sass, Less, Compass, Bootstrap grids, RWD, break points, generic header, hover, margin, padding, hex, etc.. If a programmer says something you don’t understand and you’re just nodding your head — it doesn’t bode well. Don’t assume that everything can be programmed — yes, it can — but often it is simply unprofitable and too time-consuming. It is better for both parties to consult the feasibility of one solution before starting to design.



2. The devil’s in the detail



By providing a ready project to a developer you have to be careful what you say. Even a small misunderstanding while working on a slideshow can be a nail in the coffin for good relations between the two of you. Speak with the maximum precision and consider all the possibilities — whether something in the project scales, if so, in which way, how do you want your slide title to look like if it will be longer than provided space, how pictures inside the boxes will crop if they’re too large / disproportionate etc.

There are many factors that make a designer’s and developer’s vision for the project quite different, so your common interest is to develop an universal alphabet and ways how to verify design with implementation.



3. The developer is not your enemy

We don’t like when someone pries into our work — it’s enough when our clients impose on us their brilliant ideas that we need to pursue with a smile on our faces and pain in our hearts.
When there is an extra factor — stress — we become unpleasant to the environment. What our developer can know about design?!

From our experience we ascertain you that he can know something. Even more than just something. Use the knowledge and advice of your developer. Don’t worry if he wears sandals and socks. Swallow your pride. The look from a developer’s perspective as well as revision of proposed solutions often saves a lot of time, tears, and sweat.



4. Follow the latest webdesign trends and build with “good bricks”



There is nothing that helps us more in creating a modern and fashionable project as tracking news about trends in design. However, the mere knowledge on the latest trends is only half the battle. Remember that the developer must meet every whim of yours. Keep in mind that knowledge about what can be used in a project as a timesaver is incredibly valuable for the whole team. It is always worth verifying your ideas with already existing solutions. You can go ahead and check sites such as unheap.com, where you can find ready-to-use scripts that can be successfully adapted to your project, or if you are looking for some web elements inspiration try calltoidea.com



5. Notify up to date on changes in the project



Supposedly there will be a disaster and the client comes up with another genius idea and it’s not just about making the logo bigger. We are talking about situations when the project suddenly turns around 180 degrees. Remember — always (always!) start your amendments by talking with your developer. Changing the project and submitting it without much explanation can be very annoying and will lead many men to blind rage. Take time to accurately describe changes that must be made, ask for expert opinion and start working with a clear conscience.



6. Be neat



Everyone designs in their own way. Thousands of layers without names doesn’t surprise anyone anymore, but the person finding and cutting that one tiny element will be screwed. Make sure to segregate and make descriptions — detailed documentation of typefaces letters, colors, RWD etc. accelerates work sufficiently. It can also help the dev in finding better solutions.

If you‘re responsible for cutting graphics, set the rules for naming the layers in Photoshop. Here are some examples from our studio:

image
File naming only in English:
banner.png | header.png | logo.png

Each element of the name separated by hyphen:
upper-menu.png

States of elements (buttons, icons, etc.) separated by underscore:
login.png | login_hover.png | login_active.png

The order of words in the name of the file — first name of the object, then type, then state:
arrow-left.png | arrow-right_hover.png

This way of naming your files will also help you make rapid amendments directly on the files.

Recently we started to use Creative Cloud Extract. It’s a nice tool that makes cutting elements and collaboration with developers less painful. Yet it’s still far from perfection.

7. Share knowledge and keep your finger on the pulse



Usually the final webproject is the result of a great battle between the client’s remarks, ideas of a designer and skills of a developer.
When this uneven fight ends, designer faces another challenge which is to control compliance of design and product (website or an app).

It’s impossible to move the entire project pixel by pixel among dozens of pages and headings. (OK, it’s possible but it takes angelic patientce). Thoroughness of a designer has its limits, that’s why it is important to gradually educate developers a bit about the basics of composition, typography, color theory and visual hierarchy — of course without delving into details, because we will be laughed at ;) It takes some time, but effects in the form of lack of unnecessary questions such as: “Why is it like that and not otherwise?” are priceless.



8. Trust your developer



Trust is the key in any relationship. You won’t achieve anything beautiful while being skeptical on someone’s suggestions. If the developer tells you that certain solution will be perfect for your project — trust him. He may, of course, be wrong, but be aware of the fact that his intentions are good and ruining your work is not in his interest. Certainly, trust can’t be built in one day, but sometimes you should listen to a specialist in another field to ensure that the project in the final stage will satisfy the customer, developer and you.



Summary



These tips are based on our experiences and problems encountered while working with a whole team of developers. Unfortunately, the specificity of projects where each case requires a different approach and usage of new/ different technologies makes cooperation model changing all the time. Get to know the style of work and the “language” of your developer. Discuss with him as much as possible — solutions, new technologies, trends. If you find something useful on the web (interesting animations in CSS, unusual page) — share it! These little things will bring your relationship with a developer to a whole new level.



We hope that you’ve found those tips helpful. If you know other advises on how to work with developers, feel free to share your thoughts!

6 tips for successful design critiques
webdesignerdepot.com
Few things are more stressful than a design critique. From that pressure, though, comes new viewpoints, action items, and an overall tighter product.

I believe a successful design incorporates lots of viewpoints, and critiques are a great way to collect those opinions. Design reviews should happen early and often.

Collaboration is one of the hallmarks of the new design process. No longer can designers disappear into a hole for 6 months, reemerging only when a pristine set of PSDs is ready. Without a team to provide constant feedback, it can be hard to navigate in the dark. But there are plenty of ways to critique your own design as you go.

Stopping to check the map is so much better than having to double-back after it seems like your trip is over.

 

1) Stay current with trends

Size up your design by measuring your work against successful products. Staying current with trends isn’t just about knowing what looks nice; it’s understanding why and how a solution is working for a product.

One of my favorite places to dig up inspiration is Dribbble, the show-and-tell social network for designers. While the work on Dribbble is nice, the real magic comes when you look closely at a user; check out their blog; follow them on Twitter; look at their agency’s portfolio.

A great rule of thumb when you encounter a design you love: don’t just remember it, remember why you liked it. Understanding the underlying math of any design and conversion trend is key to using it properly for yourself.

 

2) Consider the questions

Imagine questions your client might ask the first time they see your design. Now think of a way to prevent those questions from ever being asked to begin with. But don’t get tripped up in an explanation. Instead of using words to fix a shortcoming, fix it with design. It’ll go a lot further with your client (and their users).

When working alone on a project, I’ll sometimes stop to make an outline for an imaginary presentation. It takes about 5 minutes, and it shows which areas of my work I think will need extra explanation. When I’m ready to get back to work, I know exactly which areas need targeting.

Even more important than being in your client’s head? Being inside the head of your client’s customer. That’s user experience in a nutshell: squash the hurdles that might cost you a user.

 

3) Consider the users

One of my favorite time-tested UX techniques is the persona: an imaginary person who uses your product. Walk a mile in their shoes, and you’ll see things you otherwise might have missed.

Not all projects have the budget and time to go deep with lots of personas and storyboards. When you’re flying solo, try collecting a go-to set of personas—a varied set of users you carry with you from project to project. My quick persona set includes some of my family members, since I’ve had the benefit of watching them interact with tech for years. Even better, it’s a seriously varied crowd, as any good persona set should be.

My brother works in the mobile industry and understands apps like the back of his hand. My dad is an old-school computer networker, comfortable in a command line but new to touch devices. My mom is a kindergarten teacher, sharp as a whip but just getting comfortable with email and Facebook.

A solid set of personas helps keep design accessible. Each time I hit a sticky situation in the design process, I try to consider things from every viewpoint. Would my mom know what this icon means? Would my brother care?

 

4) Check with non-web friends

Watching someone actually use your product (or prototype) is even better. Live user testing doesn’t have to be some big, complex process. Just whip out your phone at a party and ask your friend what they think.

Sure, parties seem like a weird environment for light user testing, but hear me out: it’s your job, and people are generally interested in what you do. It takes less than a minute, and it’s way more fun than talking about the weather. As the night goes on, and perhaps a few drinks are consumed, the test results get even better. A drunk friend using your site is the perfect analogy for the confused, impatient user who leaves you a huffy 1-star review.

Outside of parties, user experience makes for surprisingly good small talk. Most everyone you encounter nowadays has a smartphone in their pocket, and you’ll find many enjoy talking at length about their experiences.

If you’re lucky enough to find someone that fits the bill, don’t be shy to ask about your project. Their responses might surprise you.

 

5) Ask for feedback online

If you’re working on a project alone, you’ve still got a worldwide team at your disposal: the Internet. Collect early feedback by posting progress to services like Dribbble and Behance. I often find myself sharing bits of a project online before I share with a client. It’s a chance to do some quick and dirty user testing, and a way to measure reactions with fairly minimal “risk”.

Even funded startups have taken to sharing the design process online. ProductHuntposted interactive prototypes and invited their community of thousands to start aggressively critiquing. The outcome was a tight, focused product launch that met the community’s needs.

Another one of my favorite trends I see emerging are public Slack teams. I’m currently in 3 or 4 Slack teams (1 for my job, 1 for a local group of startup workers, 1 for an online community of design folks, etc.). I’m finding these Slack teams function like a virtual coworking space. At any given time of day, there are dozens of nice people willing to answer questions, provide feedback, and take a peek at designs for a quick gut check.

Bonus: I’ve found the local group great for taco recommendations.

 

6) Take it to the team

Critiques are meaningless if you don’t act. Which is why we need to critique early and critique often. Continually ask why. Fixing a problem before becoming overly invested saves time and stress.

Even the best designers can benefit from a strong backing team. When you hit a wall, take it to the team, even if that team consists of imaginary people or an Internet message board.


The Asset Handover | CSS-Tricks
css-tricks.com
When working in teams made up of designers and front-end developers, there can be a lot of frustration and confusion when it comes to handing assets over from one team member to another. These might be design mockups or icons or high fidelity imagery for banners and the like. Regardless of the content of these handovers, there can always be improvements to this process.

Depending on the project, developers will often require certain materials in order to make development as smooth as possible. So, I’d like to review a couple of steps that designers might take in order to alleviate these pressure points.

1. Talk to developers about what they need at the beginning of the project

That sounds like an obvious statement, but in the past I’ve worked on teams where we haven’t had that conversation early enough in the process. This can lead to all sorts of failures in communication where developers don’t know which assets are the most recent ones. That can then lead to implementing features that aren’t even necessary.

Here’s some questions that you might ask at the beginning:

Are the front-end developers comfortable with Photoshop or Illustrator?
Would it be best to give them mockups in a certain application, or can they build the website with simple images that have been exported?
What image sizes do we need? How are we handling images in general? Is a build tool making all the various sizes we need?
What sort of bug tracking tool are we using? And how should we describe, name, and label new components that need to be developed?
2. Mockup handovers should be made of small, modular components

If developers receive a Photoshop document that outlines the entire design of a template, such as an About or Home page, it’s more likely that they’ll write bad code that ties all these context-specific components together. As Harry Roberts argues, this is simply bad design:

If you need to change the cosmetics of a UI component based on where it is placed, your design system is failing. It’s as simple as that. Things should be designed to be ignorant; things should be designed so that we always just have ‘this component’ and not ‘this component when inside…’.
This means it’s best for developers to build independent components and then bundle them together into a specific view later, such as that About page. This isn’t a new idea—atomic design has been telling us this for years—but my point is that the handover process should reflect this change in thinking, too.

3. Perform an interface inventory

Before we add a new item to our team’s to-do list, we need to make sure that they won’t be going over every single mockup hunting for every modification of that new component. This process of collecting every button or icon in the design should be the role of the designer, as this will help other team members extrapolate visual design changes into code.

Brad Frost has called this process an interface inventory and ideally it should document every modification and deviation of every component in the mockups:

An interface inventory is similar to a content inventory, only instead of sifting through and categorizing content, you’re taking stock and categorizing the components making up your website […] An interface inventory is a comprehensive collection of the bits and pieces that make up your interface.
After a designer has performed this interface inventory, they can begin to add all of these variations into an app like Trello, as previously we’ve mentioned how useful it is when designers can track bugs and define new features that need to be built. Instead of a block of text in our to-do list it would be best to attach those interface inventories onto the item itself, like this:


As a front-end developer, I find this much more accessible than a big ol’ directory of mockups that I’ll need to review and pick out each component (especially if I’m unfamiliar with that particular designer’s layer structure). Speaking of which…

4. If you must hand over a PSD then make sure to carefully describe each layer

Not much to say about this one, besides that it makes a whole lot of sense to keep those layers organized if someone else has to navigate them in the future.

5. Export the assets

There’s been a lot of projects I’ve worked on in the past where it’s been the developer’s responsibility to receive the mockups from the handover and pour through each file to export everything, even if they’re unfamiliar with the design. These could be banner images or icons, or even the final drafts of the copy.

However, if we have smaller handovers made up of modular components then there’s less chance for misinterpretation.

6. Only export SVG assets

Since developers now have plenty of build tools such as Grunt and Gulp at their disposal which will generate bitmap images, such as .png or .jpg’s on the fly, in certain circumstances developers will only need an SVG of a particular asset. For example, when developing a system of icons for the project. Adding these bitmap assets is probably a waste of the designer’s time in most cases, so all that’s needed is the original SVG exported from the designer’s app of choice.

Similarly it’s not a good idea to optimize the images, because our build tools will likely deal with those modifications anyway. But, if in doubt, talk to a front end developer beforehand.

7. Name icons, images, and place them in the right directory

This one is a little tricky because it involves talking to the developers again. But, naming an icon image-1.svg or icon-13.svg is obviously less useful to a developer than person-running.svg or windmill.svg. In most cases there will be some kind of pre-existing naming system for these files, especially if we need multiple versions of them for some reason, take windmill--large.svg or windmill--small.svg as an example.

Summing up

There’s no right or wrong way to do this but it does require that everyone on the team is working to the same standard. If you have access to the repo then it might be a good idea to add some of these thoughts to the readme in order to help other designers and developers in the future.

If you have any additional thoughts then be sure to add them as a comment below and I’ll add update this post for further reference.


Tactics for a Successful Design Presentation
Small changes to help make presentations more effective.
Early in my career, I would get uncomfortable and nervous whenever I had to present my work. Especially in person. With sweaty palms, I would unveil the master work that I had crafted in secret and step back quickly with a "Well, what do you think?"

I dreaded long pauses and the inevitable non-specific feedback. "Hmmm, do you think you could make the logo bigger?" "I don't know....It looks a little....too empty. Do you think you could add more ‘oomph’ to it?"

Some of you are nodding your heads right now. You know exactly what I'm talking about.

It can be easy to write off the client with "They just don't understand design." But in reality I was failing at a fundamental role of my profession:

The work does not sell itself.

The client, no matter how savvy, is not telepathic. They are concerned with how your design helps them achieve their goals. If you do not communicate this point clearly, you have devalued yourself and your work.

Clear presentations will help close long feedback loops, which means fewer hours wasted and more projects delivered on time. Happy clients, happy bank accounts.

Here are some pointers that I've found helpful over the years:

Get in front of the client.
An in-person meeting is ideal; it's much easier to react and respond in-person. You will pick up on unspoken cues that will help you understand your client,and it also works in reverse—the client will be more able to understand you! It can also provide instant feedback because you are in the room, watching their smiling (or perhaps unsmiling) faces.

There are occasions where this is impossible, either for location or scheduling reasons. A web presentation is the next best, followed by a conference call while everyone looks at the designs on their own.

Email by itself can be a terrible medium for expressing complex ideas. Many subtle cues can be lost (especially if you're a frequent user of sarcasm), and it can be easier for people to not respond to an email than if you're standing a few feet away. This is your last resort. It's workable, but takes much more effort and understanding from all parties involved.

Thank them for their time.
People are busy, attention is short. Remember this and be respectful of their time.

Remind them why they're here.
As important as you and your project obviously are, your audience may not exactly remember what they're going to be looking at that day. Remind them.

"Today we're going to be looking at some possible directions for the checkout page flow and design."

Update them on the current state of the project.
Is this phase 2, phase 3? Has your audience seen the work before? Have you already collaborated on a strategy?

"As you know, we've just completed our strategy phase and now we're entering the design phase where we will have two rounds of revisions."

Tell them exactly what type of feedback you're looking for early on.
This is the best way to avoid overly generic feedback. If you frame the format you're looking for early (as in one of the first items of the meeting, before they see anything), this will help your audience form feedback in their minds as you present.

"I'm looking for feedback on the efficiency of the checkout process."

You can phrase this as narrowly as you'd like. In the above example, you can deflect statements about photo treatments or font choices because you're only concerned with the flow right now. Log the other comments for the next phase, but keep redirecting your clients to what you want out of them.

This gets easier if everyone has already agreed on a strategy for the project beforehand (remind your client of the goal here):

"I'm looking for feedback on how this design fulfills our goal of decreasing time to purchase and boosting overall conversions by increasing the efficiency of the checkout process."

Avoid saying: "What do you think?"

It's a terrible lead-in (and yes, I've been guilty of this). When you ask this you put the burden back on the client to decipher your work and come up with a meaningful response to this question. You can get wildly different answers from this question.

Imagine if the technician who installed your air conditioning and heating system asked you this question. What do you say? "I don't know," you might think, "both hot AND cool air comes out of the vents, right?" But he's waiting for an answer, so you look around to try and find something more meaningful to say.

You're not going to notice the technician's excellent sheet metal fabrication, or the super-efficient way they've organized the wires and controls. You don't know (or perhaps care) about these things; it's why you hired someone in the first place to take care of it.

Which brings me to my next point...

Show how the client/user/audience goals are achieved.
Frame things against the context of what your audience cares about: their goals for this project.

Will the placement of the button in that particular spot drive higher conversions? Will removing other options increase the user's chance to complete a purchase? Will the treatment of the photos evoke the desired feel? Does the copy's tone drive the type of personality we want to convey?

This is where you translate your designs into their native language.

Avoid jargon.
While you're explaining your designs, cut out jargon entirely. You will lose people quickly if you let your tongue waltz off into the design ether. Speak plainly.

Which is better?

"The page was conceived with a large amount of negative space and we used a geometric sans-serif font with a large x-height juxtaposed with a dynamic serif font to capture the blend of modern and traditional."

or

"We designed the page to feel light and airy to minimize distractions and picked readable but elegant fonts."

The best case scenario with option 1 is a confused client. No one likes to feel like the student in the room. It can quickly thin their patience and erode their trust in you if you talk down to them.

Trust is your most important asset in a relationship. Don't trade it away to make yourself feel better or hide your nerves.

Make it entertaining.
No one wants to watch a boring presentation.

Monotone delivery, lack of visuals, or lots of nerves can suck the life out of your presentation. You'll have to gauge the humor level and type of your clients (mortgage bankers may require a different approach than a young tech startup founder), but allow your personality to show through.

Ever heard of power posing before speaking in front of others?

In a nutshell, it's purposely posing in a 'powerful' stance before at least 2 minutes before some sort of activity. It sounds like pseudoscience and feels a little weird but it WORKS for loosening up your body language. (Protip: don't do this in front of the client. Go do it in a private place beforehand.) When your posture is engaging you've got all sorts of sociological power juice working for you.

Another thing that helps me is to be crazy excited to speak to your audience. Not fake-excited; people can see right through that. Find what makes you excited about the project and latch onto it. Let it carry your energy through the presentation. Genuine excitement is contagious and will help cover nerves or small mistakes.

Don't run from conflict.
Inevitably people will disagree with you. Sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly, sometimes strongly, sometimes only just a little This can be a A Good Thing™.

How you deal with conflict is one of the most lasting impressions you can make in a social interaction. Did you deflect it entirely, failing to acknowledge the client's statements? Did you cave like almost immediately, labeling yourself a pushover? Did you get pissy and defensive or become belligerent?

Think back to the last argument you had (with family, a significant other, whoever). What did you do? Now think back to what they did; how did it make you feel? We're not going to go too deep into soul searching here (yet), but identifying your tendencies for dealing with conflict is important to know before you enter a conflict because it will help you course correct on the fly.

Good conflict resolution skills are like a super power, and very few people I've met are naturally good at it. If you can even get just a little better at this, it will help you tremendously, in all aspects. (I am no expert, but I have seen people who can do this well, it's amazing.)

Here's a short framework I use for dealing with conflict (large or small) in client relations:

Never assume they're “out to get you”. Move past your initial knee jerk reaction. (See Hanlon's Razor)
Acknowledge that you heard them.
This can help diffuse an initially strong reaction and start to move from statements to dialogue.
Search for the meat of their statements, what are they really getting at.
Reiterate what you really want and what you really don't want. Stay focused on those.
"What I really want is for this checkout page to be really efficient, easy to use, and effective for your business. I'd hate for the user to get bogged down with too many options."
Is there a way to satisfy both options?
Invite the other party to participate in finding a solution.
If someone is in attack/defense mode, critical thinking can pivot their behavior. Suddenly you're collaborators instead of opponents.
Each conflict is different and this script may not always work. The main point is to stay calm, remind them that you're here to help and you want the project to succeed (help ME help YOU), and that you're willing to put in the work to see it happen. A well-handled conflict (where both parties walk away satisfied) will earn you nothing but mad props.

(I strongly recommend the book Crucial Conversations for some of the more advanced conflict-management techniques. Buy it, borrow it, find it in the library — you won't regret it.)

A short checklist:
To summarize, here's my checklist before a major presentation:

DO:

Grab attention quickly (make something weird or funny happen early).
SHOW don't TELL (when possible).
Tell stories if possible (the more embarrassing the better).
Show how you achieve the client's goals.
Keep the client in their expertise comfort zone (their business).
Be crazy excited to speak to the room.
Do your homework; be prepared.
DO NOT:

Present things that are unreadable (“Can you see this in the back?”)
Pre-apologize (“We whipped this together. Didn't sleep well last night.”)
Fill the silences, especially when waiting for a response.
Explain what they can see in front of them (Captain Obvious, "This is a form, this is a button”).
Read a script (Boooooring!).
Ask if they like it.
Try to make them happy (That's a bad measure — do not avoid conflict).
Take notes (someone not presenting should do it if possible).
Get defensive.
Get too deep into design minutiae (specific colors, typefaces).
BASIC STRUCTURE:

Thank them for their time.
Tell them why they're here.
Tell them what stage you're in, with a brief reminder of the last stage.
Tell them what type of feedback you need.
Walk through the design.
How does each step further the goals of the project?
Invite questions and discussion.


Client Relationship Management: Ending the Client vs. Designer Feud
thinkapps.com
Designer Dragan Babic shares first-hand advice on client relationship management

When it comes to graphic design, it seems like there’s an age-old conflict between designer and client. It’s an ever-present battle of opinions, a tug-of-war.

Designers are hired as an essential part of the project, so why are their decisions so often challenged and even overruled by the client and other stakeholders?

As many things in design often do, it all comes down to psychology and history, to an extent. And no matter how beautiful the finished product turns out, client relationships can make or break business for both parties.

Here’s some advice on client relationship management that can help end the designer vs. client feud.

Client Relationship Management - Find Your Strengths
Client Relationship Management - Find Your Strengths
Find Your Strengths

In my experience as a designer, even though both parties share the same end goal, there is a significant gap in the approach each takes, as well as the journey to get there.

Designers must get out of their own way

The designer’s approach is all too often set by his or her strengths: deep knowledge of typography, color theory, art history, and a hefty dose of experience working on similar projects. These become the designer’s tools to solve the problem, but often the tools themselves become part of the problem he or she is trying to solve.

Too often designers succumb to their own visions of grandeur, shifting their attention away from the real problem at hand and focusing instead on issues of composition, layout, or various interactions that they want to be perfect.

Significant time can be spent — I am not using the word “wasted” on purpose, although that’s something a client might say — perfecting a design for design’s sake.

This is partly due to the way designers are taught to do things, especially in school where design is practiced in a bubble, free of constraints known to the rest of us as deadlines and budget.

Bring in the client early

Instead of approaching the project as just another reason to flex their design muscles, designers should use their clients’ domain knowledge to aid their design process.

Including the client early on in the design process can save a lot of time and effort and help bring success to the project.

Play your hand strategically

Of course, no two projects are the same, and sometimes the designer just needs to play the hand he or she is dealt.

Once the opinions start clashing, it’s best that the designer take one of two roads:

1. Educate the client about your process and insist on factual backup of all design decisions made on the project. If that fails …

2. Try to go with the flow. The client clearly has his mind set on a certain way of doing things (i.e. their way or the highway), so it’s best to concentrate on just getting the job done.

Know Your Weaknesses

On the other hand, sometimes it seems like clients are willing to sabotage their own projects if it means that they’ll get the last word.

They offer insistent opinions on color choices, typography, and many other things they know next to nothing about, which is, in fact, the reason they hired a designer in the first place.

Here’s where psychology comes in:

Your clients are scared. They’re scared that you don’t know what you’re doing and you are on their playground. They’re reluctant to let go of control because they’re not convinced that you will make the right decisions, so they grip the wheel even harder.

It’s a reflex; try not to be offended by it.

Now, obviously a designer will see this kind of direct, imperative feedback as a negative thing. And ultimately it is negative but to the project, not the designer personally. This is an important distinction to make.

Difference between success and failure

In my personal experience, the most successful projects were the ones where clients have challenged their designers, instead of locking up when they see an approach they’re not convinced will work and taking the wheel away.

A client’s main job on a design project is to point to the right problems, explain them the best he or she can, and provide as much information as possible for the designer to solve them.

There are two universal facts all failed or poorly executed projects have in common:

1. Designers don’t do their research at all or they don’t do it thoroughly enough. Sometime the clients don’t enable them to.

2. Designers and/or clients let personal preferences impact project-related decisions. All project efforts should be aimed toward success for the business, not for one individual.

Two-Way Tips for Client Relationship Management

Here are a few bits of advice that can help both the designer and the client get through a project without becoming each other’s arch nemeses.

For Designers

~ Know your stuff: Get to know the matter and don’t skip over the discovery phase. You don’t have to become an expert, but you need to know the basics of the industry and the people it affects.

~ Aesthetics are important, but not more important than the ultimate usefulness of the product you’re working on.

~ Use your client’s domain knowledge to your advantage.

~ It’s not about you.

For Clients

~ Don’t skimp on the discovery phase budget. Enable your designer to get to know the industry they are dealing with and help them do it.

~ Don’t propose solutions, expose the problems.

~ Remember that you don’t know everything. Let the people you’ve hired do their job.

~ Aesthetics will not make up for the shortcomings of your product. A pretty turd is still a turd, no way around it.

~ It’s not about you.

The Take-Away

The fact is, we shouldn’t be thinking of client relationship management in terms of one vs. the other.

The designers should be able to see their clients as an indispensable source of information and knowledge about the project, and conversely the clients should be able to find a trustworthy partner in the designers they hire.

Can’t we all just get along?

Performance is User Experience | Designing for Performance
designingforperformance.com
Think about how you search for things on the Web. How quick are you to close a tab and go to the next search engine result if a site takes too long to load? If you’re searching for local weather or news, how likely is it that you’ll return to a site that waits forever to show relevant information on your screen? As you run errands and check your phone, how likely are you to have the patience to endure long load times as you try to check your email, compare prices, or search for directions? The less time you have, the higher your expectations are for a site to load quickly.

Page speed is increasingly important for websites. If you’re looking for a page load time benchmark for your site, this is it: users expect pages to load in two seconds, and after three seconds, up to 40% of users will abandon your site. Moreover, 85% of mobile users expect sites to load at least as fast or faster than sites on their desktop. As you design and build a website, or as you examine your existing site, how are you stacking up against these expectations?

Web performance is user experience. As you design and develop a new site, you’ll consider many components of its user experience: layout, hierarchy, intuitiveness, ease of use, and more. Your site’s experience determines how much your audience trusts your brand, returns to your site, and shares it with others. Page load time and how fast your site feels is a large part of this user experience and should be weighed equally with the aesthetics of your site.

Let’s walk through some studies and data on how performance impacts end user experience.

The overall user experience affects your audience’s impression of your brand. Akamai has reported that 75% of online shoppers who experience an issue such as a site freezing, crashing, taking too long to load, or having a convoluted checkout process will not buy from that site. Gomez studied online shopper behavior and found that 88% of online consumers are less likely to return to a site after a bad experience. The same study found that “at peak traffic times, more than 75% of online consumers left for a competitor’s site rather than suffer delays.” Are you losing users to your competitors’ sites as you compete in page load time and other aspects of your site’s user experience? Are you sure that your site is faster than your competitors’?

Web performance impacts more than just ecommerce sites; improvements from page speed optimization apply to any kind of site. Users will return to faster sites, as evidenced in a study by Google that noted a decrease in searches by users who experienced a site slowdown. Users who experienced a 400-millisecond delay performed 0.44% fewer searches during the first three weeks and 0.76% fewer searches during the second three weeks of the experiment.

Further, even when users who experienced the slowdown were removed from the experiment and saw the fast experience again, they took a while to return to their previous search usage level. The impact of page load time lasts even beyond the initial poor experience; users instinctively remember how it felt to browse that site and make choices about how often to return or use it afterward based on their experience.

Additionally, page load time is factored into search engine results, bumping faster sites higher in the results list than slower sites. Google includes site speed in its search result ranking algorithm. Though Google makes it clear that it weighs content relevancy more heavily when ranking search results, page load time still contributes to the overall user experience of your site. Google wants to return results that are, overall, the best experience for its users.

Ignoring the page speed of your site is more than just a missed opportunity; it could be detrimental to users remembering your brand. Microsoft conducted a study to see how users recall sites found in search results. A half hour after participants in the study entered a self-generated query into a search box, they received an emailed survey that asked them to recall the result list without referring back to it. The results of this survey showed that one of the two main factors affecting how likely a result was to be remembered was where in the result list it was ranked. Improving your page load time can improve your search engine result ranking, which is excellent for your brand.

Brand and digital product designer Naomi Atkinson brilliantly describes how design agencies can leverage performance in their pitch to a client, saying, “a large percentage of agencies are missing out on a key selling point. Pitching how quick they plan on making their client’s website or service (and how), alongside their marketing and visual ideas, would make a world of difference. To their own success, and their clients.” Performance is part of the overall user experience, and can have a huge impact on a company’s brand.

As more users move to mobile devices and more tasks move online, your site’s overall user experience increases in importance. When we look at data from StatCounter Global Stats, we can see that mobile is steadily increasing as a total percentage of Internet traffic (Figure 1-1).

Some companies are already seeing this substantial increase in traffic from mobile devices; according to Mary Meeker’s Internet Trends report, 45% of transactions on Groupon came from mobile devices as of early 2013, which was up from less than 15% two years earlier. At Etsy, where I run the performance engineering team, 50% of user traffic comes from mobile devices as of early 2014.

Figure 1-1
Mobile % of Total Global Internet Traffic
The percentage of mobile traffic is growing for nearly every site, and this will highlight page load time issues across the Internet, particularly for handset users. One study showed that handsets are the primary Internet access method for a vast number of global Internet users. Roughly 50% of Internet users in Africa and Asia are mobile-only, in contrast to 25% in the United States. This study classified “mobile-only” users as those who never or infrequently use the desktop Internet (the study included tablets in the “desktop” category). The bottom line: lots of people are primarily using handsets to access the Internet, and these devices present their own unique set of challenges.

The first reason why handsets take longer to load web pages is how mobile data is transmitted. Before a mobile device can transmit or receive data, it has to establish a radio channel with the network (see Figure 1-2). This can take several seconds over a 3G connection. After the device talks to a radio tower to negotiate when it can transmit data, the network carrier must transmit data from the tower to its internal network and then to the public Internet. The combination of these steps can easily add tens to thousands of milliseconds of extra latency. Further, if there is no data transmitted or received on the radio channel, a timeout causes the channel to become idle. This requires a new channel to be established and the entire process to restart, potentially wreaking havoc on web page load times.

Figure 1-2
Mobile device connecting to a cell tower
As Ilya Grigorik writes, “when it comes to your web browsing experience, it turns out that latency, not bandwidth, is likely the constraining factor today.” The more latency a user experiences, the longer it takes to make a round trip from the user’s device to get data, and the longer it will take for a page to completely load. We’ll walk through more about the basics of page speed in Chapter 2.

What Are Latency and Bandwidth?

Latency is the amount of time it takes for a packet of data to get from one point to another. For example, there is latency between the time it takes a host server to receive and process a request, and latency between the server sending an asset back and a browser receiving it. Latency is bound by fundamental physical properties (such as the speed of light). This delay is often measured in milliseconds (one millisecond is a thousandth of a second).

Bandwidth is the maximum throughput of a communication path, such as how much data can be transferred at once over fiber-optic cables or your mobile carrier. As an analogy, a taxi and a bus on a shared route have the same latency, but the bus has higher bandwidth.

While it’s true that networks are slowly getting faster over time, your users on mobile devices may currently have a painful experience trying to get your site to load. On a typical United States desktop using WiFi, a request’s average round trip takes just 50 milliseconds. This is the time it takes for a browser to send a request and the server to send a response over the network. However, on a mobile network, round-trip time can be more than 300 milliseconds. To get a feel for what this means: it’s about as slow as old dial-up connections.

Add the round-trip time for each request it takes to load your site to the amount of time it takes to initially establish a radio channel with the network (potentially 1,000 to 2,000 milliseconds), and you can see how mobile network performance directly impacts your site’s user experience. Further, it’s hard to predict when wireless networks may be unreliable due to factors like a user being at a crowded event or in an area with poor reception.

This means you really need to prioritize performance as you optimize your site’s design for mobile devices, as page load time has a significant impact on mobile users’ experience and how they choose to use your site. This is evidenced by a number of companies’ studies. My team at Etsy found an increased bounce rate of 12% on mobile devices when we added 160 KB of hidden images to a page. DoubleClick, a Google ad product, removed one client-side redirect and saw a 12% increase in click-through rate on mobile devices. One of the great parts about focusing on performance benefits for mobile users is that these optimizations will also benefit your users who visit your site on any kind of device.

Your site’s user experience will be impacted by page load time, regardless of the type of device used to access it. However, a negative user experience due to slow load times will be exacerbated if your user is on a mobile device, thanks to poorer network speeds as well as the different behaviors that mobile users exhibit.

A study by Google found that people use smartphones in the following contexts:

On-the-go as well as at home
To communicate and connect
In short bursts of time
When they need information quickly and immediately
Tablets are similarly used for entertainment and browsing. Desktops, on the other hand, are used for more serious or research-intensive tasks. According to the study, smartphones are the most common starting place for the following online activities:

Searching for specific information
Browsing
Shopping
Social networking
As you design a site, consider how easily users will be able to complete tasks like these given the amount of time they plan to spend on their device in this sitting, and how significantly their mobile network may affect their ability to do so. Also remember that mobile-only users have no choice but to use their phone for all types of tasks, and that all users dislike having their time wasted, regardless of the device they are using. Your design should be intuitive and easy to use, and it should also become interactive as quickly as possible, no matter the platform.

Additionally, even when using WiFi on a handset, the user will likely have a slower experience due to antenna length and output power. WiFi can make use of more than one antenna at a time to send and receive signals; however, most smartphones aren’t configured to take advantage of the multipath technology. Further, the WiFi antennas in laptops and desktops are significantly longer than those in handsets.

Handsets also attempt to be efficient with battery power (which is a big part of the smartphone user experience), and one way for them to conserve energy is by limiting the output of their radio. Desktops don’t run on battery power, so they are able to use WiFi without making the same modifications to WiFi strength. Lastly, most smartphones currently in circulation support older and slower WiFi standards, rather than the most recent standard, 802.11ac, which only newer handsets support.

Many of the optimizations that improve page load time also improve device energy consumption, further improving the user experience. Things like WiFi signal strength, JavaScript rendering, and rendering of images all impact battery drain on mobile devices. In one study, researchers found that if Amazon converted all of its image files to JPEGs at 92% quality compression, it would save 20% of the energy needed to load its home page on an Android phone, and Facebook would save 30% doing the same. This change would positively impact the user experience by reducing energy consumption with no noticeable image quality loss. Another study found that up to 35% of page load time in the critical path is spent on computation like HTML parsing and JavaScript execution on mobile devices.

The bottom line is that your efforts to optimize your site have an effect on the entire experience for your users, including battery life.

The length of the delay between when users enter a URL, click a button, or select from a drop-down list and when the web page responds will affect their perception of the site. A delay of less than 100 milliseconds feels instant to a user, but a delay between 100 and 300 milliseconds is perceptible. A delay between 300 and 1,000 milliseconds makes the user feel like a machine is working, but if the delay is above 1,000 milliseconds, your user will likely start to mentally context-switch.

These numbers matter because collectively we are designing sites with increasingly rich content: lots of dynamic elements, larger JavaScript files, beautiful animations, complex graphics, and more. You may focus on optimizing design and layout, but those can come at the expense of page speed. Some responsively designed sites are irresponsible with the amount of markup and images used to reformat a site for smaller screen sizes; they can unknowingly force their users to download unnecessary resources.

Designers who implement responsive web design are already making decisions about how content is displayed across screen sizes; these kinds of decisions significantly impact page load time, and responsive web design is a huge opportunity to insert performance considerations into the design workflow.

Think about your most recent design. How many different font weights were used? How many images did you use? How large were the image files, and what file formats did you use? How did your design affect the plan for markup and CSS structure?

The decisions made by designers are what typically drive the rest of how a website is built. The initial design phase includes decisions about:

Colors and gradients, which impact image format choices, transparency needs, how many sprites can be created, and how much CSS3 is used
Layout, which impacts the HTML hierarchy, class and ID names, the repurposability of design patterns, and the organization of CSS
Typography, which impacts the weight and number of included font files
Design patterns, which impact what can be repurposed and cached across the site, how and when assets are loaded, and ease of editability by future designers or developers
These kinds of decisions are often determined in the beginning of the product workflow, which is why they have a large impact on the final page load time. To illustrate this, let’s say we have an example logo that we are planning to overlay on a div with a light blue background, as shown in Figure 1-3.

Figure 1-3
Figure 1-3. This example logo has a transparent background, and will be overlaid on a div with a light blue background.
The transparency and overlay requirements impact the file type and file size of this image. A designer who is considering page load time during the design stage can ask questions like, “What if I export it as a JPEG or PNG-8 with no transparency? What if I use a light blue matte on a PNG-8 file? How might that impact performance?” We can test exporting JPEG and PNG-8 versions and see the resulting file size for each in Figures 1-4 through 1-7.

Figure 1-4. Original PNG-24 with transparency: 7.6 KB.
Figure 1-5. PNG-8 with solid background: 5.0 KB.
Figure 1-6. PNG-8 with matte: 2.7 KB.
Figure 1-7. JPEG at 75% quality with solid background: 20.2 KB.
In these tests we can see that the different file formats result in different sizes due to their solid backgrounds or transparency. We will cover more about image optimizations and weighing your options in Chapter 3.

We have a huge opportunity to play around with potential performance wins and measure the impact of different design choices. In Chapter 3, we will cover how you can choose and compress a variety of image formats, and in Chapter 6 we’ll walk through how to measure and iterate on designs with page load time in mind.

The performance of both new designs and redesigns are impacted by these kinds of decisions. Every existing site can be cleaned up and tested with performance in mind. On one site, I was able to cut page load time in half by cleaning CSS and optimizing images, normalizing site colors, and carefully reorganizing assets in an existing site template. Rather than redesigning the site, I simply focused on killing bloated HTML and CSS, which resulted in smaller HTML, CSS, and stylesheet image file sizes.

You can read more about how to clean HTML and CSS with an eye on performance in Chapter 4.

Even if your job title doesn’t include the word designer, if you are making decisions about the look and feel of a website, you are making decisions that directly impact the performance of that site. Performance is a shared responsibility, and everyone on your team impacts it. Considering performance when making design decisions will have an enormous impact on your users. Weighing aesthetics and performance should be paramount in your design workflow, which we will cover in Chapter 7. This is also a huge opportunity for various disciplines within an organization to collaborate; designers and developers can work together to create a phenomenal user experience.

In the next chapter, we will walk through the basics of page load time, including how browsers fetch and render content. Understanding how your users’ browsers communicate with your hosted files, how the file size of your site’s files affect page load time, and how users perceive the performance of your site will significantly help you as you design a site and strive to find a balance between aesthetics and performance.

The Language of Modular Design
A List Apart · by Alla Kholmatova · August 11, 2015
As many of us move away from designing pages toward designing systems, one concept keeps cropping up: modularity. We often hear about the benefits of a modular approach; modules are scalable, replaceable, reusable, easy to test, quick to put together—“They’re just like LEGO!”

Modularity might appear to be a simple concept at first, but making it work for your team demands significant effort and commitment.

The biggest challenges around modularity are all the decisions that need to be reached: when to reuse a module and when to design a new one, how to make modules distinct enough, how to combine them, how to avoid duplications with the modules other designers and teams create, and so on. When modularizing an existing design or building a new one, it’s not always clear where to begin.

Start with language#section1
Language is fundamental to collaboration. In her book How to Make Sense of Any Mess, Abby Covert says that the biggest obstacle teams face is the lack of a shared language. To help establish that shared language, she suggests that we discuss, vet, and document our ontological decisions in the form of “controlled vocabularies.”

In short, we should start with language, not interfaces.

For about a year now, our team at FutureLearn, an open education platform, has been experimenting with a modular approach. I’d like to share a few ways we have tried to hone a shared language to help our team transition into modular design.

Build a pattern library as a team#section2

One of our first experiments with modularity was an attempt to redesign our homepage. A visual designer created modular slices, and we then held a workshop where we tried to organize the modules into comps. That’s what we thought (perhaps naively) a “modular design process” would look like.

Photograph of the team at FutureLearn organizing modules into comps.
One of our first experiments with modularity.
We ended up with three designs that eventually became fully functioning prototypes. But even though it was a useful exercise, the result we came up with wasn’t truly modular:

Modules weren’t clearly defined.
They didn’t have clear functions; the differences between them were often merely aesthetic.
We didn’t standardize and name them.
We didn’t put a lot of thought into how they would be reused.
Ultimately, we decided not to use the resulting designs. These experiments were useful in propelling us into a modular mindset, but the defining step toward thinking modularly was going through the process of building a pattern library as a team, which took several months (and is still in progress).

The atomic design methodology pioneered by Brad Frost served as our foundation. This is when we started looking closely at the UI, taking the interface apart, conducting inventories, and defining the core elements and patterns that we used to build new pages.

Once we had a library, we were better prepared to think about design in terms of distinct reusable components. Until then—even after all of our experiments—we were still thinking in pages.

Name things collaboratively, based on their high-level function#section3

Once you lay the foundation, it’s important to build on it by evolving the language as a team. An important part of that is naming the things you create.

Imagine you have a simple component whose function is to persuade people to take a specific online course. What would you call it?

Screenshot of a module promoting an online course in cyber security.
UI component promoting an online course on FutureLearn.
The name depends on the component’s function and how and where it appears in the interface. Some people, for example, might call it “image header” or “course promo.”

James Britton, a well-known British educator, explains in Language and Learning that by conferring names on objects, we engage in a “process of bringing [them] into existence,” just like children who use language to “call into existence, to draw out of nothingness,” the world around them. Similarly, if an object in the interface doesn’t have a name—a name that makes sense to your team, and is known and used by people on your team—then it doesn’t exist as a concrete, actionable module to work with.

Once you name an object, you shape its future. For example, if you give it a presentational name, its future will be limited, because it will be confined by its style. A functional name might work better. But functional names require more thought and are harder to arrive at, because function can be relative. For example, we almost called the component above “course poster” because it had an image of the course in the background and its function was to promote the course. It wasn’t a bad name (it was quite functional, in fact), but it was also limiting.

Around the same time, for another project, a different designer introduced a component that looked (apart from minor variations in layout and typography) quite similar to our “course poster.”

Screenshot of a module inviting learners to take part in a discussion on brain activity.
UI component inviting learners to take part in a discussion.
The function of the new component was to invite people to take part in a discussion. So the first thought that came to mind was to call it “discussion.” No one made a connection with “course poster” at first, because its name limited it to one specific function—promoting courses—and the function of “discussion” had little to do with it.

If we had given those components the names we initially thought of (“course poster” and “discussion”), we would have ended up with two named modules that were almost identical but non-reusable. Such oversights can lead to duplications and inconsistencies—which undermine modularity.

Although their functions may appear different at first, if you look at multiple uses of these components in context, or even imagine potential use cases, it’s easier to see that they both do analogous things: they serve as attention-seeking slices. They command the core calls to action on those pages. In other words: their high-level function is to focus users’ attention on the most important action.

In the end, we created a single component called a “billboard.” Billboards are not restricted by their position on the page, or by their content, or by their appearance. They can appear either with an image as the background or as part of the content. What matters is the high-level function, and that this high-level function is understood in the same way by different people on the team.

Screenshot of a billboard component with an image of a hamburger inserted between the headline and the call to action.
Example of a billboard component with an image as part of the content.
In the process of naming an element, you work out the function as a group and reach an agreement. It’s not so much about giving something a great name (although, of course, that’s an ideal to aspire to), but agreeing on the name. That determines how the element will be used and helps to ensure that it’s used consistently by everyone.

Make design language part of everyday culture#section4

Naming things this way may take longer, at least initially, because it doesn’t yet feel habitual. It requires additional effort and commitment from the whole team to make the process more familiar.

One way to make conversations about language happen is to create a physical space for them in the office.

A photograph of two walls papered in printouts of modules and naming discussions.
A space in our office where language conversations often take place.
High-level functions are easier to define if you have the whole UI printed out and intelligible at a glance. It’s also a lot easier to spot any duplications and inconsistencies that way.

Slack or other chat clients are also a viable way  to have these discussions. For example, it can help to post new elements you’ve just introduced, or existing ones that you suspect are inconsistent or potential duplicates, and then try to work out their function and find a suitable name. When thinking of names, it helps to have a common point of reference; our team often borrows terms from other industries, such as publishing or architecture, to give us ideas.

A typical naming discussion on Slack.
Keeping design language alive by making it part of our day-to-day conversations, whether in-person or remote, plays a key role in maintaining modularity within our team.

Define CSS architecture at the design stage#section5

Needless to say, reaching consensus can be difficult. For example, we may disagree on whether we should reuse an existing module, customize it for a specific context, or create a new component.

Several articles have been written about styling UI components based on context. But Harry Roberts has suggested that “having to change the cosmetics of a component in a certain context is a Design Smell”—a sign that your design is failing. How do you prevent this from happening?

What helps us is trying to standardize elements at the design stage, before building them—in other words, starting with design language. This means that developers need to understand why things are designed in a certain way, and designers need to know how the modules are built so that they can make tweaks without having to create a different version of the module.

Before writing the CSS, it’s useful for designers and developers to understand the purpose of every element they create. They might start by asking lots of questions: “Will this module always be full width? Why? Will it always include those buttons? Is the typography likely to change? Is the image background critical to the design? Are the horizontal rules part of the molecule?”

Answering these questions helps to ensure that components follow through on design intent. For example, you might choose to specify some styles at the atomic level, instead of at the organism level, to make it easier to change those properties without changing the module itself.

Involve users in the design process#section6

Another critical aspect in establishing a shared understanding is involving people from different disciplines, as well as users, in the design process from the outset. When brainstorming and sketching together, we can’t help but talk about the design elements, so we inevitably make ontological decisions that help to strengthen and evolve the design language.

Getting to the testing stage early is important, even if modules are presented as simple paper cards. Testing with ideas on cards is very different from our usual process, where we have a list of tasks and scenarios that we walk users through. Here, participants can pick up, move around, discuss, and scribble on the cards, actively becoming part of the design process. This gives us a chance to test our language choices and make sure that the functions we’ve defined make sense to our users.

Takeaways#section7
A well-established language foundation is a powerful tool that allows teams to synthesize their efforts around implementing modular design. But the way a shared design language evolves is a piecemeal, gradual, and organic process. Every person on the team plays a role in making it more coherent. Going through the process of building a pattern library as a team is an effective way to establish a language foundation. Using a solid methodology, like atomic design, can speed up the process.

Naming things together is a useful habit for your team to develop, because in the process of trying to give something a name that makes sense, you work out its function and, most importantly, reach consensus. The agreed-upon name determines how the element will be built and encourages consistent usage across the team. As Abby Coverts writes, “If you don’t get agreement up front, prepare for more work later.”

Make an effort to refer to the elements by the name you agreed on—no matter how strange this might sound in everyday conversations. It takes more effort initially to call something a “whisper box” (yes, we have an element called “whisper box”) rather than “that thing with the lines and an icon in the middle.” But until you start referring to an element by its proper name, it doesn’t exist in your modular system as a solid, actionable block. Every time you use the name you agreed on, you strengthen the element you call on and evolve your design language.

Put your language to the test outside of your team by using it throughout the company, with other teams, and with users. It’s always interesting to see what sticks—it’s a real kick when someone outside the product team starts using the name, too.

Finally, remember that no language (aside from a few exceptions) exists in isolation. By evolving and strengthening your design language, you have an opportunity to contribute to the larger language of the web, and to help make it more consistent and coherent for everyone.

**********

The idea behind the hamburger menu is that you can use it to hide site navigation on smaller screens, showing it only when the user clicks the icon instead of always showing it (which was the previous norm).

This design pattern accomplishes a major goal by preserving precious real estate on mobile, tablet, or other small screens, and it’s consistent with the logic of the progressive disclosure design pattern.

Brilliant solution, right?

The hamburger menu was so rapidly adopted and remains so beloved by digital designers that it may be too late to change course anytime soon. It’s built into every major front-end framework, every new WordPress theme, and pretty much every new site that’s been designed in the last couple of years.

And that’s a really bad thing.

Other designers often look at me like I’m crazy when I try to explain why the hamburger menu is often a bad idea. They take for granted that it’s the “One True Way” to handle navigation on small screens.

In his article “Obvious Always Wins,” Luke Wroblewski, Product Director at Google, gives various before-and-after examples of the failures of apps that switched to hamburger-style navigation and the successes of those that switched away from it. 

Probably the highest-profile case of hamburger failure came from NBC News, who got so excited about this hot (in 2014, anyway) navigation style that they used it on their desktop site as well, billing it as a triumph of “mobile first” design:

But, as so often happens, the hamburger menu didn’t work.

So they added an instructional overlay, to help users understand how to use their simple menu:

As a last-ditch attempt to solve the problem, they made it yellow:

Then, finally (as you can see on the promo at the bottom of the image above), they gave up and redesigned the navigation to a more traditional horizontal menu style, which has worked well for them and remains the same basic design they use today.

Why is it so hard to shake the hamburger menu?

Here are a few reasons why the design industry is having trouble giving up the hamburger menu:

It’s a designer’s dream. What if we could take that awkward horizontal navigation and just make it disappear so we don’t have to deal with it on mobile devices? If it actually worked, it’d be heavenly.
Designers are sometimes more focused on trends than logic. In 2014, all the sexy responsive sites jumped on the hamburger menu bandwagon, and it was proclaimed the next big thing. Anyone who was a cool designer started using it, because that’s what other cool designers used. (Not necessarily to be cool, because they assumed if someone big was using it, the thinking was already done.) They even started developing slick animations when perhaps they really should have been asking about the interaction logic and doing user testing.
It’s built into everything now. The emergence of the hamburger menu icon coincided with the heavy adoption of front-end frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation, both of which come with robust horizontal navigation solutions that default to a hamburger menu on mobile and even tablet form factors. To avoid using the hamburger menu when using these frameworks’ menu options, you’d actually have to hack the code to remove it, or custom code a new navigation setup from scratch.
Unsexy news travels slowly. The news that we’d conquered the problem of converting navigation for mobile devices ripped through the industry like a zombie virus. It seemed like everyone started using it almost overnight. Unfortunately, interaction design theory, A/B testing, and metrics that challenge the mirage aren’t nearly as viral.
Would anyone ever want this hamburger?

It’s important to remember that there aren’t any universal rules in design. There are always exceptions.

For example, a repetitive-use application with trained users (e.g., a medical application used by nurses throughout the course of the day) may be a valid scenario for using such an interface. “Power user” systems don’t always need to make things intuitive for new users, and sacrifices can and should sometimes be made in order to give additional benefits—such as information density—to experienced users.

Another example might be (as seen in the Facebook example above) truly secondary navigation items. Once the most important elements have been explicitly listed for the user, you can scoop up all the miscellaneous additional stuff that nobody’s going to look for anyway and throw it under a low-priority hamburger menu.

Universally declaring hamburger menus to be totally terrible is as bad as declaring them to be always awesome. Rules are no replacement for thinking. Consider the user, do the math, and figure out what actually makes the most sense.
