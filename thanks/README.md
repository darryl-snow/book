This book is merely a collection of my thoughts and experiences from the past several years. Much of my professional career has been influenced, if not totally and willfully submissively indoctrinated by, the following clever people and resoucres. This section of the book not only represents my eternal gratitude but also a curated list of what I think really are the best online learning resources for any web professional.

* **Paul Boag & Marcus Lillington**

  I began listening to the Boagworld show - the world's first web-related podcast, on the 2nd or 3rd episode and have listened religiously ever since. Paul and Marcus offer extremely valuable insight into everything about running successful web projects, as well as plenty of friendly banter.

* **Chris Coyier**

  A true inspiration. This man really got me excited about the web at a time when my interest was starting to wane - around the time of the browser wars, when CSS was struggling to take hold. He's become a celebrity in the industry with his name appearing on every major blog, newsfeed, podcast, and conference speakers list. He's done it not by being the smartest or the most knowledgable, but by sharing everything he learns and generally being an extremely nice chap.

* **The Shoptalk Show with Chris Coyier and Dave Rupert**

  This podcast is great for all the little tips about web design and development. In combination with the Boagworld show you can learn everything you need to know about how to be a great web professional.
